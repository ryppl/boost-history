    include various build logs in each message.

    By default, the message will be sent to the Interested Users list, which
    includes all developers who made changes in the build. You can add
    additional recipients with the extraRecipients argument.

        @param addLogs: if True, include all build logs as attachments to the

                        set to a list of log names, to send a subset of the

                          the VC system) into valid email addresses. If not
