    <h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Since the design and rationale for <b>Boost.Smart Pointer</b> is largely documented
    in <cite>Modern C++ Design</cite>, this document shall cover the changes from the Loki
    implementation.  Also covered are policy implementation details for those wishing to
    write their own policies.</p>
    <h2><a name="optimally_inherit"></a><code>optimally_inherit&lt;&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>While there is not currently a consensus on how policy parameters should be passed
    to a policy-based smart pointer, this library follows the original Loki design in choosing
    Multiple Inheritance.  Of concern to smart pointer users is the size of the smart pointer
    itself.  An unnecessarily large smart pointer can potentially waste a lot of memory, as
    it is likely to be used in containers and other contexts which generate many instances of
    the pointer.  Ordinarily, there is no memory cost to single-parent inheritance of empty
    base classes, as most compilers implement Empty Base Optimization (EBO).  Thus, inheriting
    from a single policy generally does not elicit code bloat.  However, in the face of 
    multiple inheritance, EBO has been found inconsistent or entirely lacking on many 
    platforms.  Thus, inheriting from multiple empty base classes may increase the size of the
    pointer needlessly.</p>
    <p>To circumvent this problem, Andrei Alexandrescu suggested an OptionallyInherit template 
    which examines the size of its arguments to determine whether or not it should inherit 
    from each parameter.  David Held implemented this technique with a few modifications and 
    named it <code>optimally_inherit&lt;&gt;</code>.  The actual 
    <code>optimally_inherit&lt;&gt;</code> template is a type generator intended to be used as 
    a base class for policy-based types.  While this technique effectively eliminates the 
    MI-EBO pessimization, it does not come without cost.  The most important limitation is that 
    empty policies cannot contribute new interface to the smart pointer type.  This is because 
    empty policies do not become part of the inheritance tree of the smart pointer.  
    Constructor validation is preserved, and empty policies can still define which policy 
    variants they will accept.  But any new interface methods introduced by a policy must be 
    declared static.</p>
    <h2><a name="array_storage"></a><code>array_storage</code></h2>
    <p>Loki did not support array policies by default, because Andrei felt that smart pointers
    were not an appropriate facility for dealing with arrays.  The Boost community at large
    dissented, and so <b>Boost.Smart Pointer</b> defines an <code>array_storage</code> 
    StoragePolicy.  This policy defines all the usual operations one would expect from a
    smart pointer to an array.</p>
    <h2><a name="ordering-comparisons"></a>Ordering Comparisons</h2>
    <p>The original Loki::SmartPtr left ordering comparison operators (<code>&lt;, &lt;=, 
    &gt;=, &gt;</code>) undefined, because they are potentially dangerous.  The current library
    also leaves the operators incompletely defined, but allows the user to enable them by
    defining BOOST_SMART_POINTER_ORDERING_OPERATORS.</p>
    <h2><a name="portability"></a>Portability</h2>
    <p><b>Boost.Smart Pointer</b> strives to achieve the high level of portability typical of
    Boost libraries.  In many respects, that goal has been achieved.  However, the extensive
    use of member template functions makes this a non-negotiable feature upon which the 
    library depends.  Thus, this library is only usable on platforms that at least support
    BOOST_MSVC6_MEMBER_TEMPLATES.  The latest perusal of the Boost.Config files shows that only
    two compilers fail to support this feature, and they are both older versions of compilers
    which currently support the feature.  Thus, this requirement should not be overly 
    burdensome for users.</p>
    <h2><a name="policy-categories"></a>Policy Categories</h2>
    <p>One of the criticisms of policy-based design is that it leads to potentially complex
    types which may be difficult for end-users to properly declare.  Thus, solutions such as
    named template parameters and policy adaptors have been devised to support the use of
    policy-based designs.  While a policy adaptor does not currently exist for <b>Boost.Smart
    Pointer</b>, one may be introduced in the future.  To support this possibility, the
    default policies define a policy_category.  New user-defined policies should also define
    this type by selecting one of the tags below:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>boost::storage_policy_tag</dt>
      <dt>boost::ownership_policy_tag</dt>
      <dt>boost::conversion_policy_tag</dt>
      <dt>boost::checking_policy_tag</dt>
    </dl>
    <h2><a name="const-correctness"></a><code>const</code> Correctness</h2>
    <p>StoragePolicies must now define:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>stored_type</dt>
      <dt>const_stored_type</dt>
      <dt>pointer_type</dt>
      <dt>const_pointer_type</dt>
      <dt>reference_type</dt>
      <dt>const_reference_type</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>in support of const-correctness for <code>smart_ptr</code>.
    <h2><a name="current-pointers"></a>Current Boost Smart Pointers</h2>
    <p>While the ultimate fate of smart pointer technology remains a foggy mystery, it seems
    only reasonable to support as many useful smart pointer designs as possible.  As such,
    <b>Boost.Smart Pointer</b> includes a set of policies which allow <code>smart_ptr</code>
    to emulate the current Boost smart pointers (<code>shared_ptr&lt;&gt;, weak_ptr&lt;&gt;,
    intrusive_ptr&lt;&gt;, and shared_array&lt;&gt;</code>).  Whether or not this is necessary 
    or useful is a matter of considerable controversy.  However, since the policies already
    exist, it costs nothing to provide them to users.</p>
