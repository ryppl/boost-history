    <p><b>Boost.Smart Pointer</b> began life as Loki::SmartPtr, the brainchild of Andrei
    Alexandrescu.  As such, basically the entirety of the design and a good deal of the 
    implementation are his original work.  It was modified by David B. Held to conform to
    the Boost style and coding conventions (as well as integrate with existing Boost 
    facilities).  Changes and enhancements beyond the original Loki design were also
    implemented by David.</p>
    <p>Gennadiy Rozental offered extensive comments and suggestions, having implemented
    another variant of Loki::SmartPtr.</p>
    <p>Documentation and test programs were written entirely by David Held, with concepts
    taken from <cite>Modern C++ Design</cite>, as appropriate.  The Boost HTML Documentation 
    Templates by <a href="../../../people/william_kempf.htm">William Kempf</a> were used to
    produce the documentation.  Thanks to Bill for the excellent templates!</p>
    <p>Other people who have made comments or contributed suggestions to this library are 
    (in alphabetical order): David Abrahams, Giovanni Bajo, Greg Colvin, Beman Dawes, 
    Peter Dimov, and Phil Nash.  Apologies to anyone I may have missed.</p>
