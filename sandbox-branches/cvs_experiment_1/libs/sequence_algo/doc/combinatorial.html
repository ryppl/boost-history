A common problem in discrete mathematics is the need to generate all the
permutations or combinations of a subset of objects from a larger set of
objects. The STL's permutation algorithms, next_permutation and prev_permutation,
will work on entire sets, but not on subsets and obviously, will only return
permutations. For this reason, I've written a suite of generic combinatorial
algorithms to complement the existing functions. Specifically, they are
algorithms to implement ordered and unordered selection without replacement,
referred to as r-permutations and r-combinations, respectively, in many texts.
For instance, see <A href="#Johnsonbaugh">[1]</A>.
<P>
The programs have been compiled and tested on MacOS 9 using Metrowerks
Codewarrior version 5 and on Windows 98 using Microsoft Visual C++ version
6.0.

There are eight primary functions in this collection and they follow the
format and semantics commonly found among functions in the STL. They are

<P>
They're defined in the header file <STRONG>conbinatorial.hpp</STRONG> in
the directory boost/sequence_algo. They are members of the boost namespace.
The file itself uses a function from the boost library, so make sure that
the Boost directory is in your header include path. See the example programs
listed in the section below.
<P>
Items in input sequences must either work with the built-in less than (&lt;)
operator, have a less than operator defined, or have a user-defined binary
comparison operation provided at the point of call.
<P>
Like the STL's permutation algorithms, objects in the input sequence to these
functions should be in lexicographical order (based on the less than operator,
unless a binary comparison function is supplied) on the first call.
<P>
The input must define a strict weak ordering <A href="#Musser">[3]</A>.

<STRONG><A name="next_r_permutation">next_r_permutation</A></STRONG> - arranges
the elements in [first, r), from the larger range [first, last) where first
&lt; r &lt;= last, such that they represent the next r-permutation of elements
in lexicographical order. When calling the function for the first time, the
elements in [first, last) must be in ascending lexicographical order. Typically,
when the function is called it arranges the next r-permutation in [first,
r) and returns true. When the last permutation in lexicographical order is
passed in, the function sorts the entire range, [first, last) into ascending
order, restarting the sequence, and returns false.

time, the elements in [first, last) must be in descending lexicographical

r-permutation in [first, r) and returns true. When the first permutation
in lexicographical order is passed in, the function sorts the entire range,

exists, it arranges the next r-combination in [first, r) and returns true.
If the next combination does not exist, the function sorts the entire range,
[first, last) into ascending order, thus restarting the sequence, and returns

The following programs include boost/sequence_algo/conbinatorial.hpp, headers
from the C++ standard library, and Boost. Make sure these files are in your
compiler include paths.

<DL>
  <DT>
    <STRONG>combinatorial_ex1.cpp</STRONG>
  <DD>
    This is interactive console I/O program presents a menu that lets you run
    each function individually. It is in the libs/sequence_algo/example subdirectory.
  <DT>
    <STRONG>combinatorial_ex2.cpp</STRONG>
  <DD>
    This console I/O program solves a puzzle from a recent "Ask Marilyn" column
    in <CITE>Parade</CITE> magazine using next_r_permutation. It reads in the
    dictionary file lexicon.txt. You'll the files in the libs/sequence_algo/example
    subdirectory.
  <DT>
    <STRONG>test_combinatorial.cpp</STRONG>
  <DD>
    This program uses the Boost Unit Test framework for error reporting and is
    compatible with the Boost regression test program. It is a modification and
    elaboration of combinatorial_ex1.cpp. The interactive functionality has been
    removed so that the program may be run in the "batch" mode required by
    regression.cpp.Individual tests have been added for each of the subordinate
    functions in conbinatorial.h. Data and test cases were chosen to implement
    basis path, boundary, and condition testing. Test_combinatorial.cpp sits
    in the libs/sequence_algo/test subdirectory. To build this program, it is
    necessary to link to cpp_main.cpp and test_main.cpp in boost/test.
