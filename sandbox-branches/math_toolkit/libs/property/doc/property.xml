   <para>
      The concept of a property originated in GUI and Rapid Application
      Development (RAD) environments, providing introspection/reflection and
      RAD-based value manipulation. A property is an entity that behaves
      like a public data member, but the value is retrieved through a
      getter function and assigned using a setter function.
   </para><para>
      In C++/CLI, a property is implemented like this:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   class object
   {
      int val;
      public:
         property int Val
         {
            int get() const{ return this -> val; }
            void set( int v ){ this -> val = v; }
         }
   };
</programlisting>
   <para>
      It can be accessed like a standard data member:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   object ob;
   ob.Val = 5; // calls Val.set( 5 );
   assert( ob.Val == 5 ); // calls Val.get();
</programlisting>
   <para>
      Borland and MS VC++ provide a similar mechanism for defining properties
      in C++, for example:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   class object
   {
      int val;
      public:
         int get_val() const{ return val; }
         void set_val( int v ){ val = v; }
         __declspec(property(get=get_val, set=set_val)) Val;
   };
</programlisting>
</section><section id = "prop.motivation"><title>Why Are Properties Useful?</title>

   <para>
      One of the principles of OOP is that of encapsulation. This is where
      you prevent direct manipulation of an objects internal state, but provide
      methods and constructors to control it. A motivation for this is to
      validate the data (for example, ensuring that the month value is in
      range), however this leads to potentially non-intuitive usage, for
      example:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   date d;
   d.set_month(  7 );  // ok
   d.set_month( 13 ); // error: thow?
</programlisting>
   <para>
      The use of properties here can simplify such usage by providing a more
      intuitive C++-style syntax:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   date d;
   d.month =  7;  // ok
   d.month = 13; // error: thow?
</programlisting>
   <para>
      Another use is in writing more generic code. For example, GUI libraries
      provide a data structure for providing a rectangle in 2D cartesian
      coordinates. If you want to provide access to the rectangle data without
      restricting yourself to a particular platform, properties become
      essential. They allow you to define xpos, ypos, width and height
      properties and map them to the corresponding implementation.
   </para><para>
      If you are a COM programmer, the C++ classes that define a COM interface
      have many get/set functions for various data elements. Using properties
      allows you to write code with these interfaces in a more intuitive way.
   </para>
</section><section id = "prop.cpp"><title>Properties In C++</title>
   <para>
      So far we have seen property mechanisms that require intervention by the
      compiler to add the boilerplate code needed for properties to interact
      with C++. As such, properties are compiler-dependant and are not
      available to a purely C++98 conforming compiler. Therefore, code using
      properties is not portable.
   </para><para>
      As well as not being standard code, properties do not always interact
      with normal C++ code as you would expect. For example, if you have a
      property that is declared as an array of a type that has a subscript
      operator (like std::map), the compiler will complain if you attempt to
      access the subscript operator together with indexing the property. For
      example:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   struct object
   {
      property std::map&lt; std::string, int &gt; data[];
   };
   object ob;
   ob.data[ 5 ][ "Martin" ] = 5;
      // error: set_data does not take 3 parameters
</programlisting>
   <para>
      Lois Goldthwaite has published a proposal for C++ properties implemented
      as a library solution (N1615). I have used that for the inspiration for
      this library.
   </para>
</section><section id = "prop.type"><title>Properties Overview</title>
   <para>
      In describing properties, I have borrowed terminology from Tensor
      algebra. As such, the number of indices associated with a property is
      given by the Rank of that property. For example, a matrix property would
      be of rank 2 since it has two indices.
   </para><para>
      The implementation of properties is split into two groups. There are the
      classes that provide the boilerplate code required to provide the natural
      usage of a property from within C++. This group is defined independantly
      of how a property is stored and manipulated.
   </para><para>
      The second group provide get and set functions to allow access to the
      property. They have the following typedefs:
   </para>
   <table><title>Property Typedefs</title><tgroup cols = "2" align = "left" valign = "top">
      <thead><row>
         <entry>typedef</entry>
         <entry>description</entry>
      </row></thead>
      <tbody>
         <row>
            <entry><simpara><code>value_type</code></simpara></entry>
            <entry><simpara>
               The base type of the property.
            </simpara></entry>
         </row><row>
            <entry><simpara><code>constructor_type</code></simpara></entry>
            <entry><simpara>
               This is the type of the value that is passed to the property
               implementation in order to initialize that property. For
               example, passing a reference to a variable if the property is
               an aliasing property.
            </simpara></entry>
         </row><row>
            <entry><simpara><code>subscript_type</code></simpara></entry>
            <entry><simpara>
               If <code>value_type</code> provides subscripting facilities,
               this type specifies the value returned by the subscript
               operator.
            </simpara></entry>
         </row><row>
            <entry><simpara><code>index_type</code></simpara></entry>
            <entry><simpara>
               If <code>value_type</code> provides subscripting facilities,
               this specifies the type of the index used by the subscript
               operator.
            </simpara></entry>
         </row>
      </tbody>
   </tgroup></table>
   <para>
      In order to simplify the creation of these typedefs, the property
      library provides two classes:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   template
   &lt;
      typename ValueType, typename ConstructorType = ValueType,
      typename SubscriptType = ValueType &amp;, typename Index = int
   &gt;
   struct boost::property_type;

   template&lt; typename Prop, typename ConstructorType = Prop &gt;
   struct boost::inherited_property_type;
</programlisting>
   <para>
      <code>boost::property_type</code> will define a new property type and
      <code>boost::inherited_property_type</code> will take the types
      as defined in <code>Prop</code> and bring them into scope of this
      property, except for <code>constructor_type</code> that is defined
      independantly.
   </para>

</section><section id = "prop.scalar"><title>Scalar Properties</title>
   <para>
      A scalar property is one that has a rank of 0, i.e. it contains only a
      single element. It has the form:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   template&lt; typename Prop &gt;
   class boost::scalar_property;
</programlisting>
   <para>
      where <code>Prop</code> is a class implementing get and set functions,
      having the form:
   </para>
<programlisting>
   struct Prop: public boost::property_type&lt; ... &gt;
   {
      value_type get() const;
      void set( const value_type &amp; v );

      inline Prop( constructor_type c );
   };
</programlisting>

   <section id = "prop.simpprop"><title>Simple Properties</title>
      <para>
         A simple property is one that is a wrapper for a data value. There are
         two basic types:
      </para><para>
         A value property holds its own data and provides a property interface
         to it. This is implemented via the <code>boost::value_property</code>
         class, for example:
      </para>
<programlisting>
   scalar_property&lt; value_property&lt; int &gt; &gt; ival( 0 );
   ival = 7;
</programlisting>
      <para>
         An aliased property is a property that holds a reference to an
         external data type that stores the real value. This is implemented
         via the <code>boost::aliased_property</code> class, for example:
      </para>
<programlisting>
   int i;
   scalar_property&lt; aliased_property&lt; int &gt; &gt; ival( i );
   ival = 2;
   assert( i == 2 );
</programlisting>
      <para>
         The original example at the beginning of this guide can be expressed
         more cleanly as an aliased property. For example:
      </para>
<programlisting>
   class object: public boost::noncopyable
   {
      int val;
      public:
         scalar_property&lt; aliased_property&lt; int &gt; &gt; Val;
         object(): Val( val ){}
   };
</programlisting>
   </section><section id = "prop.objprop"><title>Object Properties</title>
      <para>
         An object property is a property that is a wrapper around getter and
         setter functions in a class. This is implemented via the
         <code>boost::readonly_object_property</code> class for properties
         that only supply a get method and <code>boost::object_property</code>
         for properties that have both get and set methods.
      </para><para>
         The original example at the beginning of this guide can be expressed
         via an object property if the get and set functions are needed. For
         example:
      </para>
<programlisting>
   class object: public boost::noncopyable
   {
      int val;
      public:
         int get_Val() const{ return val; }
         void set_Val( const int &amp; v ){ val = v; }
         scalar_property&lt; object_property
         &lt;
            int, object,
            &amp;object::get_Val, &amp;object::set_Val
         &gt; &gt; Val;
         object(): Val( this ){}
   };
</programlisting>
      <para>
         Note how the decleration of the set method differs from the C++/CLI
         version requiring the value to be defined as a const reference.
      </para>
   </section>
</section><section id = "prop.issues"><title>Known Issues</title>
   <section id = "prop.assign"><title>Assignment</title>
      <para>
         Because properties prevent access to copy constructor and assignment
         operations, the following example produces an error:
      </para>
<programlisting>
   object o1, o2;
   o1.Val = 2; // ok
   o2.Val = o1.Val; // error
   o2.Val = o1.Val(); // ok
   o2.Val = o1.Val.get(); // ok
</programlisting>
   </section><section id = "prop.using"><title>Using Inside A Class</title>
      <para>
         If you are using properties in a class (like object in the examples)
         then you need to suppress the compiler-generated copy constructors
         and assignment operations. You can either make them private in your
         class or provide your own implementations of them.
      </para><para>
         Note that this is only needed for classes that have properties as
         members. Other classes derived from them do not need to do this
         unless they contain properties themselves.
      </para><para>
         For example:
      </para>
<programlisting>
   class Integer
   {
      int val;
      public:
         int get_Val() const{ return val; }
         void set_Val( const int &amp; v ){ val = v; }
         scalar_property&lt; object_property
         &lt;
            int, object,
            &amp;object::get_Val, &amp;object::set_Val
         &gt; &gt; Val;

         const Integer &amp; operator=( const Integer &amp; i )
         {
            val = i.val;
            return *this;
         }
         Integer( const Integer &amp; i ):
            val( i.val ), Val( this )
         {
         }
         Integer( int i ): val( i ), Val( this ){}
   };
</programlisting>
