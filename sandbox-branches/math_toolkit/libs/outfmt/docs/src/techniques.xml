<section id = "outfmt.techniques"><title>Techniques</title>
   <para>
      This section goes over some applications of this library that go beyond it's
      goal of allowing you to format sequential types to a stream.
   </para>
   <section id = "outfmt.serialization"><title>Serialization</title>
      <para>
         This library can be used to perform simple serialization. See
         <ulink url = "../../example/serialize.cpp">libs/outfmt/example/serialize.cpp</ulink>
         for examples on doing this. Robert Ramey's Boost.Serialization library is
         now a part of Boost and offers better serialization facilities.
      </para>
   </section><section id = "outfmt.dataread"><title>Reading In Data: A Simple Parser</title>
      <para>
         If you have data that is in a specific text format, it is possible to use
         this library to read that data into the program. For example, given:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
   2.75, 3.112
   7.1, 9.98765
   ...</programlisting>
      <para>
         Each line of data can be represented as:
      </para>
      <programlisting>   typedef std::pair&lt; float, float &gt; data_entry;</programlisting>
      <para>
         If the file is loaded into a <code>std::ifstream</code> called <code>in</code>, the
         data can be read in using the following code:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
  std::list&lt; data_entry &gt; data;
  data_entry elem;
  while( in )
  {
     in &gt;&gt; boost::io::format( elem ).format( "", "\n" );
     if( in ) data.push_pack( elem );
  }</programlisting>
      <para>
         This is hard to do trivially in Boost.Spirit. If there is an "end-of-data" marker,
         for example <code>[eod]</code>, the code becomes even simpler:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
   std::list&lt; data_entry &gt; data;
   in >> boost::io::format
         (
            data,
            boost::io::containerfmt( boost::io::pairfmt().format( "", "\n" ))
         ).format( "", "[eod]" );</programlisting>
   </section>
