                      capabilities of the standard library. It is very understandable 
                      that the standard cannot include algorithms for everything, but
                      many C++ users find a need for more algorithms than are currently 
                      present. An important part is not only the new algorithms, but also
                      overloaded versions of existing algortihms that works on containers. This
                      can be thought of merely as syntactic sugar, but it opens up for safer and better
                      functional style programming.</p><hr size="1" ><h2  >Overview</h2><a name="Overview" ></a><p  >Here is a list of the modules that make up the library:</p>
<ul  >
  <li  > <a href="container_algo.html" target="_self" >Standard Container Algortihms:</a> 
    overloaded versions of the standard library algorithms that will work with 
    a variety of containers.</li>
  <li  > <a href="minmax.html" target="_self" >Min/Max Algorithms:</a> find the 
    minimum and maximum value in one go.</li>
  <li  > <a href="combinatorial.html" target="_self" >Combinatorial Algorithms:</a> 
    extensions that complement <code  >std::next/prev_permutation().</code></li>
  <li  > <a href="lcs.html" target="_self" >Longest Common Subsequence:</a> find 
    common data from two source sequences.</li>
  <li  ><a href="edit_distance.html" target="_self">Edit Distance:</a> calculate 
    the number of changes required to transform one sequence into another </li>
  <li  ><a href="boyer_moore.html" target="_self">Boyer Moore:</a> fast sub sequence 
    searching</li>
  <li  > <a href="misc.html" target="_self" >Miscellaneous:</a> predicates like 
    <code  >none()</code> and <code  >all()</code> and more.</li>
</ul>
<p  >Everything can be included by using one big header <code  >sequence_algo.hpp</code>. Alternatively, each library documents their own header policy for more fine-grained
                     control. Please note that that everything is put in namespace <code  >boost::algorithm.</code></p><hr size="1" ><p  >&copy; Thorsten Ottosen 2003 (nesotto@cs.auc.dk).
