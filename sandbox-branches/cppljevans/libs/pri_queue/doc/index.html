    <p>A <strong>priority queue</strong> is a queue that enforces some ordering policy on its elements during its entire lifetime.  The basic priority queue provides two operations: a <em>push</em> operation, which inserts an element, and a <em>pop</em> operation, which removes the minimum element according to the queue's ordering policy.  Even the simple <a href="../../utility/queue.html">queue</a> can be thought of as a priority queue where the minimum element is the one least recently inserted.  Most priority queue implementations, however, impose <em>external</em> ordering policies, which are not intrinsic to either the queues or the elements themselves.  Most priority queues also provide one or more <em>update</em> operations for maintaining the integrity of their internal structures when their ordering policies <em>change</em>.  This ability to update a priority queue is vital for applications such as thread scheduling and <a href="../../graph/doc/">graph algorithms</a>.</p>
    <p>Boost provides the following priority queues.  All of them model the <a href="../../utility/Buffer.html">Buffer</a> concept.  With the exception of the <tt>fenced_priority_queue</tt>, they also model the <a href="../../utility/UpdatableBuffer.html">Updatable Buffer</a> concept.</p>

      <li><a href="./fibonacci_heap.html">fibonacci_heap</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <a href="./indirect_cmp.html">indirect_cmp</a> function object adaptor provides the actual external ordering on a priority queue's elements.  Without <tt>indirect_cmp</tt>, the priority queue's <tt>update</tt> operation is next to useless.</p>
    <p>The priority queue is a standard data structure, and is discussed in all algorithm books worth their ink.  For more ideas on their general usage, see <a href="http://www.leekillough.com/heaps/">http://www.leekillough.com/heaps/</a>.</p>
