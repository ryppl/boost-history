[section Tutorial]


[section General use]

The only header you need to include to use the library is
`<boost/mp_math/integer.hpp>`. This is a header-only library so deployment is easy.
All functions and types of this library live in namespace `boost::mp_math`.

  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>
  #include <boost/mp_math/integer.hpp>

  using namespace boost::mp_math;
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
    // init from string
    integer<> x("93423894782394782347823947289374");
    // init from integral type
    integer<> y = 2340;
    integer<> z = x * y;

    // stream output reacts to stream flags
    cout << hex << z << endl;

    // automatic detection of radix using the base prefix 0x
    z = "0xaaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff222255557777";

    z /= y;

    // explicit conversion to string according to formatting flags
    string s = z.to_string<string>(ios::hex | ios::showbase);
    cout << s << endl;

    z -= z;

    // explicit conversion to built in integral types - this will throw
    // std::overflow_error if int does not have enough precision to hold the
    // result
    int result = z.to_integral<int>();

    return result;
  }

In most cases the `integer` type will behave like a built in integral type.

[section Random number generation]

The random number generators have interfaces similar to Boost.Random. Including
`<boost/random.hpp>` is not necessary because it is used internally by the
`integer` random machinery. The random number engine `mt19937` that we use from
here on lives in namespace `boost`.


  const integer<> min(0U);
  const integer<> max("0x8974651231456456564");

  uniform_mp_int<> generator(min, max);

  // Choose a random number engine.
  mt19937 e;

  // Now generate a random number.
  integer<> r = generator(e);


Another probably more useful alternative is to generate random numbers of a
certain precision measured in bits.


  // A generator for 2048 bit integers.
  uniform_mp_int_bits<> generator(2048);

  mt19937 e;
  integer<> r = generator(e);

Note that the numbers will always be 2048 bits large, i.e. the 2048th bit is
always set to 1.

[section Primality testing]

Currently all primality tests in this library are probabilistic. A probabilistic
primality test cannot ascertain that a prime candidate p is really prime. It can
however ascertain that it is a composite number.

Here we will learn how to test a number `p` for primality using the fermat
primality test. We use boost::bind to bind the random number engine to the test
functor. That is necessary because the test functor's function invocation
operator needs the random number engine. The operator looks like this:

  bool operator()(Engine& e, const integer<>& p) const;

We need to bind the random number engine to the first parameter slot. Let's do
it!

  // Create the fermat test functor with 4 rounds of testing.
  primality_fermat_test<> test(4);

  // Create a random number engine.
  mt19937 rng;

  // Create a random 1024 bit candidate number.
  integer<> p = uniform_mp_int_bits<>(1024)(rng);

  bool is_p_prime = is_prime(p, bind(test, rng, _1));

[section Prime number generation]


[section prime_generator]

First we will look at how to generate prime numbers using a simple trial
division test. What this means is that the prime generator creates a random
number and then repeatedly divides it by small primes until it finds a number
that passes this test.

  // Create a generator for 2048 bit primes.
  prime_generator<primality_division_test> generator(2048);

  // Create a random number engine.
  mt19937 rng;

  // Now create a prime.
  integer<> prime = generator(rng);


[endsect][/prime_generator]


[section safe_prime_generator]

A safe prime is a prime `p` for which `(p-1)/2` is also prime. Such prime numbers
are much rarer and thus take longer to generate.

Now we will look at how to use a more sophisticated primality test like
`primality_miller_rabin_test` for prime number generation. It is very useful to
combine this test with the `primality_division_test`. This will involve a bit of
code, mostly because `primality_miller_rabin_test` and `safe_prime_generator`
require a random number generator. The latter needs randomness to create a
candidate to test for primality and the miller rabin test needs randomness to
test the candidate effectively.

  // Define a function object that checks a prime candidate p first with a trial
  // division and then with the miller-rabin algorithm. For ease of use we give
  // it default template arguments.
  // It does not hold a reference to the random number engine because that could
  // lead to lifetime problems.
  template<
    class Engine = mt19937,
    class Distribution = uniform_integer_bits<>
  >
  struct primality_test
  {
    primality_division_test                   test1;
    primality_miller_rabin_test<Distribution> test2;
    Engine rng;

    explicit tester(const Engine& e = Engine()) : rng(e) {}

    bool operator()(const integer<>& p)
    {
      return test1(p) && test2(rng, p);
    }
  };

  // Create a random number engine that we will feed to the different
  // algorithms.
  mt19937 rng;

  // Create a generator for safe primes with 128 bits precision.
  typedef safe_prime_generator<primality_test<>, uniform_integer_bits<> >
    generator_type;

  generator_type generator(128, primality_test<>(rng));

  integer<> prime = generator(rng);

Remember, the generated numbers are ['probably] prime.

[section Using the GMP backend]
First, in addition to `<boost/mp_math/integer.hpp>` include the file
`<boost/mp_math/gmp.hpp>`. Then define your integer type like this:

  typedef boost::mp_math::integer<boost::mp_math::gmp_integer<> > gmp_int_type;

You then need to link manually to the GMP library.

This type is more limited than the native backend:

* does not work with the primality tests and the random number generation
  templates
* a few other things don't work yet or don't work correctly

and features slightly different semantics:

* will default initialize to zero
* will behave on bitwise operations like a two's complement integer

and it has the annoying C gotcha of raising a signal on
division by zero. I am not sure about the repercussions of catching that signal
and translating it to a C++ exception, so I'm just leaving it as it is right
now. In addition to that you will have to be prepared to catch exceptions
thrown by the C++ wrapper code.
