[section Introduction]
This library provides the `mp_int` class template for arbitrary precision signed
integers. These integers grow dynamically as needed. Additionally, special
functions which are necessary for the implementation of public key cryptography
such as prime generation are provided.

[heading Acknowledgement]

This library originally started as a port of the C code of libtommath. Without
the huge amount of work done by its author Tom St. Denis, this library wouldn't
have been possible. Not only does he provide free C code, but also a very
detailed pdf document of over 200 pages explaining the algorithms used in his
code. Both his documentation and his code were placed in the public domain. In
the spirit of his work the code of the `mp_int` library and its documentation
are placed in the [*public domain] as well.
