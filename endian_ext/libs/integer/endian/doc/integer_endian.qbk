[section Overview]
[/========================]



[/====================================]
[heading How to Use This Documentation]
[/====================================]

This documentation makes use of the following naming and formatting conventions.

* Code is in `fixed width font` and is syntax-highlighted.
* Replaceable text that you will need to supply is in [~italics].
* Free functions are rendered in the code font followed by (), as in `free_function()`.
* If a name refers to a class template, it is specified like this:   `class_template<>`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `<>`   to indicate that it is a class template.
* If a name refers to a function-like macro, it is specified like this: `MACRO()`;
  that is, it is uppercase in code font and its name is followed by `()` to   indicate that it is a function-like macro. Object-like macros appear without the   trailing `()`.
* Names that refer to /concepts/ in the generic programming sense are  specified in CamelCase.

[note In addition, notes such as this one specify non-essential information that provides additional background or rationale.]

[note In addition, notes such as this one specify non-essential information that provides additional background or rationale.]

Finally, you can mentally add the following to any code fragments in this document:

    // Include all of endian files
    #include <boost/integer/endian.hpp>
    using namespace boost::integer;

[/=================]
[section Motivation]
[/=================]
   
The original Beman's version provided through the boost::integer::endian<> class an integer-like class that providing arithmetics operations on 

* Big endian | little endian | native endian byte ordering.
* Signed | unsigned
* Unaligned | aligned
* 1-8 byte (unaligned) | 2, 4, 8 byte (aligned)
* Choice of integer value type

This endian aware design seems to be unappropiated to work with endian unaware types, but as we will see this is not completly true, as we can construct on top of the Beman's design endian unaware operation. Next follows some of the main critics that have been done recently.

[heading Intrusive verus non-intrusive]
[/====================================]

Endian conversion must be possible to any type even if you can't modify the original source code. Many people think that originel Beman's library requires the data types which need to be converted to be coded using his endian types as members. 

We will see that this is not true, as the user can always use casting to reinterpret a given structure on another one, as the proposed extension does with the endian_views.

    struct endian_unaware_structure {
        int32_t a; 
        int16_t b; 
    };
    endian_unaware_structure st_a;
    
    endian_unaware_structure st_b;
    as_endian<native>(st_b) = as_endian<big>(st_a);

[heading Physical versus Logical data]
[/===================================]

The typical use case is to use native endianness until ready to read/write using wire format.  It is only when ready to do I/O that there is a need to account for endianness.

Beman's original library requires two types one to specify the physical data and the other representing the logical data.  
Many people think that this means that the user has to maintain two separate structs/classes when only one is needed. This could be sometimes the case, but in other cases, the user will store the information elements include in the message on local variables and specific contexts that don't follow the external format.

Applications that don't separate the physical and the logical data structures don't scale well as any change on the external format will mean a refactoring of the whole application. Also, the wire structures cannot maintain invariants, so having a separate class is often useful even if its contents are essentially identical to the wire version.

In addition a single and efficient view is only possible when the pysical view can be represented by native aligned integers. But when the physical view contains unaliged integers with sizes not supported by the platform, the need to separate both view becomes anavoidable. Here the Beman's design is the best adapted.

[heading Inherent inefficient arithmetic operations]
[/=================================================]

The fact that the endian types provide operators gives the impression that it's ok to operate on them, as these operations can potentially require two endian conversions when the endianness is different.  

Some people don't agree with that design choice, as they think the operation of endian conversion and operating on the data should be divorced from each other.  A less experienced user that you may end up not realizing what the hidden costs are and use the endian aware integer-like types throughout the application, paying unnecessary overheads.  They prefer a library that makes hard to misuse in that way; borrowing a phrase from python, "explicit is better than implicit".  They believe that forcing the user to do the explicit endian conversion leads to better separation of concerns for the application, but they don't propose any mean to force this conversion.

The extension proposal separates the endian aware byte-holder type from the one able to make arithmetic operations so the user will be forced to convert for one to/from the native type, and avoid unfortunate costly atithmetic operations. 

    struct endian_aware_structure {
        endian_pack<big,int32_t> a;
        endian_pack<big,int16_t> b;
    };


Structure endian_aware_structure can not be used without converting to native types, as endian_pack don't provide other operations than conversion.

    endian_aware_structure st;
    // ...
    st.a=i;
    st.b=j;

But don't removes the inefficient and endian safe class, as less demanding applications would benefit from the safe and transparent approach.

[heading In-place conversion]
[/==========================]

Other contexts force the user to make in place conversions. While this could be dangerous, there are context on which a funtional conversion is not possible, mainly because the duplicated space could not be an option. These in-place conversions are only possible for aligned endian unaware types.

    struct endian_unaware_structure {
        int32_t a; 
        int16_t b; 
    };
    endian_unaware_structure st;
   
    as_endian<native>(st) = as_endian<big>(st);

The fact that some context need this in-place conversion doesn't mean that every application should use this approach.


[heading UDT endianness]
[/=====================]

boost::integer::endian class didn't accept a UDT. We have updated the library so now UDT can be used for endian aligned types.

    struct UserMessage {
      endian_pack<little, system_clock::time_point > timestamp;
      ulittle32_pt aircraft_id;
      struct Position {
         endian_pack<little, quantity<si::length, boost::int_least32_t> > x;
         endian_pack<little, quantity<si::length, boost::int_least32_t> > y;
         endian_pack<little, quantity<si::length, boost::int_least32_t> > z;
      } position;
      struct Attitude {
          endian_pack<little, quantity<si::plane_angle, boost::int_least8_t> > heading;
          endian_pack<little, quantity<si::plane_angle, boost::int_least8_t> > pitch;
          endian_pack<little, quantity<si::plane_angle, boost::int_least8_t> > roll;
      } attitude;
    }; // UserMessage


[heading Mixed endianness]
[/=======================]

Sometimes we need to deal with messages with mixed endianness.
A functional approach means the programmer has to "know" which endianess the data he wants to convert has.

    struct UdpHeader {
      ubig16_pt source_port;
      ubig16_pt destination_port;
      ubig16_pt length;
      ubig16_pt checksum;
    }; // UdpHeader

    struct Packet {
      internet::UdpHeader udpHeader;
      UserMessage userMessage;
    }; // Packet



[/A real-world use-case that uses multiple endians and has 
different protocol layers.
That is one over-the-wire packet has several layers of headers, possibly 
with different endian alignment than the user payload contained.  This is 
common on PC's which often have big-endian IP headers and then have a 
little-endian user payload.  The whole packet is read in from a socket at 
once into a data buffer owned by a unique_ptr, so the message is not copied 
from layer-to-layer.  I work on proprietary, non-internet networks, so I'm 
not sure which protocol headers we should use for a use-case.  In my 
wireless applications, the headers are usually padded to an integral number 
of bytes, but fields within the headers are sometimes not byte-aligned.
]


[heading Floating point]
[/====================================]

From my understanding floating point types are not only concerned by endianness, but also by a multitude of standard on not standard formats.

[heading Conclusion]
[/=================]

The library must support applications needing to work safely with endian aware types and efficiently with in place endian conversions.

Conversions between native and big/little endian formats must be simple.

[endsect]


[/==================]
[section Description]
[/==================]

This is an extension of the Beman's Boost.Integer.Endian, which was able to work with endian aware types, used to convert between types with different endian or even to carry on with arithmetic operations, by spliting the endian part from integer part and by adding support for aligned endian unaware types. 

__Boost_Endian provides:

* Endian packs
    * Big endian | little endian | native endian byte ordering.
    * Signed | unsigned
    * Unaligned | aligned
    * 1-8 byte (unaligned) | 2, 4, 8 byte (aligned)
    * Choice of integer value type

* Endian integers with the whole set of arithmetics operators.

* Operators <= and => for unformatted binary (as opposed to formatted character) stream insertion and extraction of built-in, std::string types and of endian types.

* Views of aligned endian unaware integer types as endian packs or endian integers so we can make endian conversion.

* Generic in place conversion between different endian formats. 
    * Very simple interface: convert_to/from<endiannes domain>(),
    * Support for built-in and user-defined data types view as fusion sequences.

[heading Getting __Boost_Endian]
[/=================================]

You can get the last stable release of __Boost_Endian by downloading [^integer_endian.zip] from the
[@http://www.boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?directory=Portability%20Programming Boost Vault]

You can also access the latest (unstable?) state from the [@https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/endian_ext Boost Sandbox].

[heading Building __Boost_Endian]
[/====================================]

__Boost_Endian is implemented entirely within headers, with no need to link to any Boost object libraries.

Several macros allow user control over features:

* BOOST_ENDIAN_NO_CTORS causes class endian to have no constructors. The intended use is for compiling user code that must be portable between compilers regardless of C++0x Defaulted Functions support. Use of constructors will always fail,
       
* BOOST_ENDIAN_FORCE_PODNESS causes BOOST_ENDIAN_NO_CTORS to be defined if the compiler does not support C++0x Defaulted Functions. This is ensures that , and so can be used in unions. In C++0x, class endian objects are POD's even though they have constructors.



[/=========================]
[heading Requirements]
[/=========================]

__Boost_Endian depends on some Boost library. The library has been tested on trunk but an older version should works also. 

In particular, __Boost_Endian depends on:

[variablelist
[
    [[@http://www.boost.org/libs/config [*Boost.Config]]] [for configuration purposes, ...]
]
]

[/========================]
[heading Exceptions safety]
[/========================]

All functions in the library are exception-neutral and provide strong guarantee of exception safety as long as the underlying parameters provide it.

[/====================]
[heading Thread safety]
[/====================]

All functions in the library are thread-unsafe except when noted explicitly.

[/=======================]
[heading Tested compilers]
[/=======================]

The implementation will eventually work with most C++03 conforming compilers.
Current version has been tested on:

[/Windows with

* MSVC 10.0

[/===================]
[section Limitations ]
[/===================]

Requires `<climits> CHAR_BIT == 8`. If `CHAR_BIT` is some other value, compilation will result in an `#error`. This restriction is in place because the design, implementation, testing, and documentation has only considered issues related to 8-bit bytes, and there have been no real-world use cases presented for other sizes.

In C++03, endian does not meet the requirements for POD types because it has constructors, private data members, and a base class. This means that common use cases are relying on unspecified behavior in that the C++ Standard does not guarantee memory layout for non-POD types. This has not been a problem in practice since all known C++ compilers do layout memory as if endian were a POD type. In C++0x, it will be possible to specify the default constructor as trivial, and private data members and base classes will no longer disqualify a type from being a POD. Thus under C++0x, endian will no longer be relying on unspecified behavior.

[heading Binary I/O warnings and cautions]

[warning Use only on streams opened with filemode `std::ios_base::binary`. Thus unformatted binary I/O should not be with the standard streams (`cout`, `cin`, etc.) since they are opened in text mode. Use on text streams may produce incorrect results, such as insertion of unwanted characters or premature end-of-file. For example, on Windows `0x0D` would become `0x0D`, `0x0A`.]

[warning Caution: When mixing formatted (i.e. operator `<<` or `>>`) and unformatted (i.e. operator `<=` or `>=`) stream I/O, be aware that `<<` and `>>` take precedence over `<=` and `>=`. Use parentheses to force correct order of evaluation. For example:

```
    my_stream << foo <= bar;    // no parentheses needed
    (my_stream <= foo) << bar;  // parentheses required 
```
As a practical matter, it may be easier and safer to never mix the character and binary insertion or extraction operators in the same statement.

[/=========================]

[heading basic endian holders]

__Boost_Endian provides an endian aware byte-holder class template:

    template <endianness::enum_t E, typename T, std::size_t n_bytes=8*sizeof(T),
      alignment::enum_t A = alignment::aligned>
    class endian_pack;

This class provide portable byte-holders for data, independent of particular computer architectures. Use cases almost always involve I/O, either via files or network connections. Although data portability is the primary motivation, these byte-holders may also be used to reduce memory use, file size, or network activity since they provide binary integer sizes not otherwise available.

Such byte-holder types are traditionally called endian types. See the Wikipedia for a full exploration of endianness, including definitions of big endian and little endian.

This class doesn't provides arithmetic operators, but of course automatic conversion to and assignment from the underlying integer value type are provided.

    #include <boost/integer/endian/endian_pack.hpp>
    #include <iostream>

    using namespace boost;
    using namespace boost::integer;
    using namespace boost::integer::endianness;


    int main()
    {
        int_least32_t v = 0x31323334L;  // = ASCII { '1', '2', '3', '4' }
                                      // value chosen to work on text stream
                                      
        endian_pack<big, int_least32_t>    b(v);
        endian_pack<little, int_least32_t> l(v);

        std::cout << v << ' ' << b << ' ' << l << '\n';
        return 0;

[heading endian holders common typedefs]


Sixty typedefs, such as big32_t, provide convenient naming conventions for common use cases:


[table
    [[Name]                     [Endianness]  [Sign]                    [Sizes in bits (n)]         [Alignment]]

    [[`little`*n*`_t`]          [`little`]    [signed]                  [8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64]    [`unaligned`]]

    [[`aligned_big`*n*`_t`]     [`big`]       [signed]                  [16,32,64]                  [`aligned`]]
    [[`aligned_ubig`*n*`_t`]    [`big`]       [unsigned]                [16,32,64]                  [`aligned`]]

]

The unaligned types do not cause compilers to insert padding bytes in classes and structs. This is an important characteristic that can be exploited to minimize wasted space in memory, files, and network transmissions.

[warning  Code that uses aligned types is inherently non-portable because alignment requirements vary between hardware architectures and because alignment may be affected by compiler switches or pragmas. Furthermore, aligned types are only available on architectures with 16, 32, and 64-bit integer types.]

[note One-byte big-endian, little-endian, and native-endian types provide identical functionality. All three names are provided to improve code readability and searchability.
]

[*Comment on naming]

When first exposed to endian types, programmers often fit them into a mental model based on the <cstdint> types. Using that model, it is natural to expect a 56-bit big-endian signed integer to be named `int_big56_t`. But these byte-hodlers are not realy integers.

That seems to lead to formation of a new mental model specific to endian byte-holder types. In that model, the endianness is the key feature, and the integer aspect is downplayed. Once that mental transition is made, a name like `big56_t` is a good reflection of the mental model.



    #include <boost/integer/endian/endian_pack.hpp>
    #include <iostream>

    using namespace boost;
    using namespace boost::integer;


    int main()
    {
        int_least32_t v = 0x31323334L;  // = ASCII { '1', '2', '3', '4' }
                                      // value chosen to work on text stream
        big32_t    b(v);
        little32_t l(v);

        std::cout << v << ' ' << b << ' ' << l << '\n';
        return 0;
    }

On a little-endian CPU, this program outputs:

    825373492 825373492 825373492
    

[heading endian holders of UDT]

The user can define wrappers to integer types that behave as integers, as it is the case for 
quantity<> class. This UDT can be packaged on an endian holder to take care of endian issues, as show the following example.

    #include <boost/integer/endian/endian_pack.hpp>
    #include <boost/integer/endian/endian_binary_stream.hpp>

[section Endian aware integers]
[/===========================]

Boost endian integers are based on the byte_holder endian_pack class template and provide in addition the same full set of C++ assignment, arithmetic, and relational operators as C++ standard integral types, with the standard semantics.

One class template is provided:

    template <typename E, typename T, std::size_t n_bytes=8*sizeof(T),
      alignment::enum_t A = alignment::aligned>
    class endian;

Unary arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `~`, `!`, prefix and postfix `--` and `++`. Binary arithmetic operators are `+`, `+=`, `-`, `-=`, `*`, `*=`, `/`, `/=`, `%`, `%=`, `&`, `&=`, `|`, `|=`, `^`, `^=`, `<<`, `<<=`, `>>`, `>>=`. Binary relational operators are `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

Automatic conversion is provided to the underlying integer value type.

[heading Typedefs]


Sixty typedefs, such as big32_t, provide convenient naming conventions for common use cases:

[heading Comment on naming]

When first exposed to endian types, programmers often fit them into a mental model based on the <cstdint> types. Using that model, it is natural to expect a 56-bit big-endian signed integer to be named `int_big56_t`.

As experience using these types grows, the realization creeps in that they are lousy arithmetic integers - they are really byte holders that for convenience support arithmetic operations - and that for use in internal interfaces or anything more than trivial arithmetic computations it is far better to convert values of these endian types to traditional integer types.

[section Examples]

[section:aware Endian Aware]

The endian_example.cpp  program writes a binary file containing four byte big-endian and little-endian integers.

This is an extract from a very widely used GIS file format. I have no idea
why a designer would mix big and little endians in the same file - but
this is a real-world format and users wishing to write low level code
manipulating these files have to deal with the mixed endianness.

Low-level I/O such as POSIX read/write or <cstdio> fread/fwrite is sometimes
used for binary file operations when ultimate efficiency is important.
Such I/O is often performed in some C++ wrapper class, but to drive home the
point that endian integers are often used in fairly low-level code that
does bulk I/O operations, <cstdio> fopen/fwrite is used for I/O in this example.


    #include <iostream>
    #include <cassert>
    #include <cstdio>
    #include <boost/integer/endian.hpp>

    using namespace boost::integer;

    namespace 
    {

      struct header
      {
        big32_t     file_code;
        big32_t     file_length;
        little32_t  version;
        little32_t  shape_type;
      };

      const char * filename = "test.dat";
    }

    int main()
    {
      assert( sizeof( header ) == 16 );  // requirement for interoperability

      header h;

      h.file_code   = 0x04030201;
      h.file_length = sizeof( header );
      h.version     = -1;
      h.shape_type  = 0x04030201;

      std::FILE * fi;

      if ( !(fi = std::fopen( filename, "wb" )) )  // MUST BE BINARY
      {
        std::cout << "could not open " << filename << '\n';
        return 1;
      }

      if ( std::fwrite( &h, sizeof( header ), 1, fi ) != 1 ) 
      {
        std::cout << "write failure for " << filename << '\n';
        return 1;
      }

      std::fclose( fi );

      std::cout << "created file " << filename << '\n';
      return 0;
    }

After compiling and executing endian_example.cpp, a hex dump of test.dat shows:

    0403 0201 0000 0010 ffff ffff 0102 0304

[note Omission of bool and void* is deliberate; any semantics would be questionable]

[warning
Note the asymmetry between output and input; a string with embedded
nulls will be output with the embedded nulls, but input will stop at the first null.
So it probably isn't a good idea to use these functions for strings with nulls.

        template <typename Domain, typename T>
        struct endian_type {

The member typedef `type` names one of the `endianness` types `big`, `little` or `mixed`. If all the leaves of the type T are of the same endianness type is this endiannes, otherwise it is `mixed`.

The default behavior works for all the endian aware types, fundamental types and any type that is a fusion sequence. 

The user can specialize this metafunction for specific clases.

[heading Example]

    is_same<endian_type<endian<endianness::big, int> >::type, endianness::big>::value == true
    is_same<endian_type<int>::type, endianness::native>::value == true

[section [*Version 0.1.0, June 15, 2010]]

Split of Boost.Integer.Endian + Added Endian views.

[*Features:]

* Endian packs
    * Big endian | little endian | native endian byte ordering.
    * Signed | unsigned
    * Unaligned | aligned
    * 1-8 byte (unaligned) | 2, 4, 8 byte (aligned)
    * Choice of integer value type

* Endian integers with the whole set of arithmetics operators based on endian pack.

* Operators <= and => for unformatted binary (as opposed to formatted character) stream insertion and extraction of built-in, std::string types and of endian types.

* Views of aligned endian unaware integer types as endian packs or endian integers so we can make endian conversion.

* Generic in place conversion between different endian formats. 
    * Very simple interface: convert_to/from<endiannes domain>(),
    * Support for built-in and user-defined data types view as fusion sequences.

[section:rationale Appendix B: Rationale]

[heading Design considerations for __Boost_Endian]

* Must be suitable for I/O - in other words, must be memcpyable.
* Must provide exactly the size and internal byte ordering specified.
* Must work correctly when the internal integer representation has more bits that the sum of the bits in the external byte representation. Sign extension must work correctly when the internal integer representation type has more bits than the sum of the bits in the external bytes. For example, using a 64-bit integer internally to represent 40-bit (5 byte) numbers must work for both positive and negative values.
* Must work correctly (including using the same defined external representation) regardless of whether a compiler treats char as signed or unsigned.
* Unaligned types must not cause compilers to insert padding bytes.
* The implementation should supply optimizations only in very limited circumstances. Experience has shown that optimizations of endian integers often become pessimizations. While this may be obvious when changing machines or compilers, it also happens when changing compiler switches, compiler versions, or CPU models of the same architecture.
* It is better software engineering if the same implementation works regardless of the CPU endianness. In other words, #ifdefs should be avoided where possible.

[heading Experience]

Classes with similar functionality have been independently developed by several Boost programmers and used very successful in high-value, high-use applications for many years. These independently developed endian libraries often evolved from C libraries that were also widely used. Endian integers have proven widely useful across a wide range of computer architectures and applications.

[heading Motivating use cases]

Neil Mayhew writes: "I can also provide a meaningful use-case for this library: reading TrueType font files from disk and processing the contents. The data format has fixed endianness (big) and has unaligned values in various places. Using __Boost_Endian simplifies and cleans the code wonderfully."

[heading C++0x]

The availability of the C++0x Defaulted Functions feature is detected automatically, and will be used if present to ensure that objects of class endian are trivial, and thus POD's.

[section:implementation Appendix C: Implementation Notes]

[heading FAQ]

* *Why bother with endian types?* External data portability and both speed and space efficiency. Availability of additional binary integer sizes and alignments is important in some applications.

* *Why not just use Boost.Serialization?* Serialization involves a conversion for every object involved in I/O. Endian objects require no conversion or copying. They are already in the desired format for binary I/O. Thus they can be read or written in bulk.

* *Why bother with binary I/O? Why not just use C++ Standard Library stream inserters and extractors?* Using binary rather than character representations can be more space efficient, with a side benefit of faster I/O. CPU time is minimized because conversions to and from string are eliminated. Furthermore, binary integers are fixed size, and so fixed-size disk records are possible, easing sorting and allowing direct access. Disadvantages, such as the inability to use text utilities on the resulting files, limit usefulness to applications where the binary I/O advantages are paramount.

* *Do these types have any uses outside of I/O?* Probably not, except for native endianness which can be used for fine grained control over size and alignment.

* *Is there a performance hit when doing arithmetic using integer endian types?* Yes, for sure, compared to arithmetic operations on native integer types. However, these types are usually be faster, and sometimes much faster, for I/O compared to stream inserters and extractors, or to serialization.

* *Are endian types POD's?* Yes for C++0x. No for C++03, although several macros are available to force PODness in all cases.

* *What are the implications endian types not being POD's with C++03 compilers?* They can't be used in unions. Also, compilers aren't required to align or lay out storage in portable ways, although this potential problem hasn't prevented use of __Boost_Endian with real compilers.

* *Which is better, big-endian or little-endian?* Big-endian tends to be a bit more of an industry standard, but little-endian may be preferred for applications that run primarily on x86 (Intel/AMD) and other little-endian CPU's. The [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endian Wikipedia] article gives more pros and cons.

* *What good is native endianness?* It provides alignment and size guarantees not available from the built-in types. It eases generic programming.

* *Why bother with the aligned endian types?* Aligned integer operations may be faster (20 times, in one measurement) if the endianness and alignment of the type matches the endianness and alignment requirements of the machine. On common CPU architectures, that optimization is only available for aligned types. That allows I/O of maximally efficient types on an application's primary platform, yet produces data files are portable to all platforms. The code, however, is likely to be more fragile and less portable than with the unaligned types.

* *Endian types are really just byte-holders. Why provide the arithmetic operations at all?* Providing a full set of operations reduces program clutter and makes code both easier to write and to read. Consider incrementing a variable in a record. It is very convenient to write:

    ++record.foo;

Rather than:

    int temp( record.foo);
    ++temp;
    record.foo = temp;

* *Why do binary stream insertion and extraction use operators <= and >= rather than <<= and >>=?* <<= and >>= associate right-to-left, which is the opposite of << and >>, so would be very confusing and error prone. <= and >= associate left-to-right.

[section:acknowledgements Appendix D: Acknowledgements]

Original design developed by Darin Adler based on classes developed by Mark Borgerding. Four original class templates combined into a single endian  class template by Beman Dawes, who put the library together, provided documentation, and added the typedefs. He also added the unrolled_byte_loops  sign partial specialization to correctly extend the sign when cover integer size differs from endian representation size.

[heading Tasks to do before review]

* Support for 'pure' endian conversion for endian unaware UDT.

* Support for 'in place' endian conversion for ranges of endian unaware types.

* endian iterator, which will iterate across a range endian converting values as necessary. It works with any type supporting the convert_to/from functions.

[heading For later releases]

* The library doesn't take advantage of special instructions on architectures which natively support endian conversion. This functionality could, however, be part of future releases.
