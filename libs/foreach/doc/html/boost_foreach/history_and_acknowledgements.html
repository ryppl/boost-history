<p>
The ideas for <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">BOOST_FOREACH</span></tt> began life in the Visual C++ group at Microsoft during the early phases of
the design for C++/CLI. Whether to add a dedicated "foreach" looping construct to the language was
an open question at the time. As a mental exercise, Anson Tsao sent around some proof-of-concept
code which demonstrated that a pure library solution might be possible. The code was written in the
proposed C++/CLI dialect of the time, for which there was no compiler as of yet. I was intrigued by
the possibility, and I ported his code to Managed C++ and got it working. We worked together to
refine the idea and eventually published an article about it in the November 2003 issue of the
<a href="http://www.cuj.com" target="_top">CUJ</a>.</p>
<p>
After leaving Microsoft, I revisited the idea of a looping construct. I reimplemented the macro
from scratch in standard C++, corrected some shortcomings of the CUJ version and rechristened it
BOOST_FOREACH. In October of 2003 I began a discussion about it on the Boost developers list, where
it met with a luke-warm reception. I dropped the issue until December 2004, when I reimplemented
BOOST_FOREACH yet again. The new version only evaluated its sequence expression once and correctly
handled both l-value and r-value sequence expressions. It was built on top of the recently
accepted <a href="http://boost.org/libs/range/index.html" target="_top">Boost.Range</a> library, which increased its portability. This was the version that, on Dec. 12 2004,
I finally submitted to Boost for review. It was accepted into Boost on May 5, 2005.</p>

Thanks go out to Anson Tsao of Microsoft for coming up with the idea and demonstrating its feasibility.
I would also like to thank <a href="http://boost.org/people/thorsten_ottosen.html" target="_top">Thorsten Ottosen</a> for
the <a href="http://boost.org/libs/range/index.html" target="_top">Boost.Range</a> library, on which the current version of <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">BOOST_FOREACH</span></tt> is built.</p>
