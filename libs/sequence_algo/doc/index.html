                      capabilities of the standard library. It is very understandable 
                      that the standard cannot include algorithms for everything, but
                      many C++ users find a need for more algorithms than are currently 
                      present. An important part is not only the new algorithms, but also
                      overloaded versions of existing algortihms that works on containers. This
                      can be thought of merely as syntactic sugar, but it opens up for safer and better
                      functional style programming.</p><hr size="1" ><h2  >Overview</h2><a name="Overview" ></a><p  >Here is a list of the modules that make up the library:</p><ul  ><li  > <a href="container_algo.html" target="_self" >Standard Container Algortihms:</a> overloaded versions of the standard library algorithms
