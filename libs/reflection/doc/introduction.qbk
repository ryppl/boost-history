[section:introduction Introduction]

Reflection is the ability of a computer program to observe its structure and
possibly modify it. Our library tries to achieve that objective, easing the 
development of this kind of programs and releasing the programmer of the
task of constructing a meta-level layer describing the classes and methods.

In short, Boost.Reflection has a set of classes that allows the programmer to
store information about their C++ classes and methods, and use (call) them
using run-time identifiers. For example, we can create a class, attach some
meta-level information and then use run-time strings to select the method that
we want to call.

Unfortunately, the library is not fully developed yet. It only has the basic
functionalities and it's not much than an interesting prototype on the subject.

The documentation is, also, completely incomplete. Sorry. Look at tutorial #1 
for examples of basic usage.
