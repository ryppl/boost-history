<h1>Blas bindings regression and performance tests</h1>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
The executables blas1, blas2 and blas3 (that can be built with bjam in
this directory) both serve as:
<ul>
<li>regression-tests for the blas-bindings for ublas vectors and matrices</li>
<li>regression-tests for ublas routines</li>
<li>and as performance test for the ublas routines in respect to the equivalent BLAS operations</li>
</ul>
The first two tests are achieved by performing several uBlas vector and matrix
operations with the native uBlas implementation and the equivalent operation
via the blas bindings and comparing the results of both.<br>
The latter test is achieved by repeating every operation many times too
be able to time the uBlas native and the equivalent BLAS operation.

<h3>Performance test</h3>
To run the executables for performance test purposes, launch the executable
with two arguments.<br>
The first argument must be the number of times every operation will be repeated
in order to time it. This must be at least 1e5 for a 500Mhz PIII.<br>
The second argument is the size up to which the vectors and matrices will be
sized when testing the performance.<br>
For every test, a file is created, with a name describing the test, that contains
5 columns of data. The first column is the size of the vector of matrix that
was timed. The second and fourth column provide the estimated MFlops for the
uBlas native and BLAS implementation respectively. The third and fifth column
provide the normalized-time (normalized in respect to the size) for performing
the operation.

<h3>Regression tests</h3>
To run the executables for regression-test purposes, no arguments need to 
be provided. You will however see a lot of 'inf' on your screen because
the timer is not accurate enough to provide timing info.
