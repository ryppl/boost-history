<h1>Bindings documentation</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
The bindings library contains bindings to external (numeric) libraries (that
is: extenal to boost) such as BLAS, LAPACK, CBLAS and AMOS. These bindings
can be used for uBlas vectors and matrices, std::vector, boost::array etc.

<h3><a href="traits/doc/index.html>Traits</a></h3>

<h3>Amos</h3>

<h3>Blas</h3>
First the blas-bindings are split in plain C-bindings for blas
and next higher-level bindings. The C-bindings are direct matches
on the fortran signature. The C++ bindings however also change the 
signature (e.g. return value not as extra parameter, ...)

<h3>cblas</h3>

<h3>LAPACK</h3>
Uses a traits class to map the functions for the different value_type's. This
is possible for all calls for which the signature does not change for the different
value_type's.
