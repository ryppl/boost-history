<h1>Bindings documentation</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
The bindings library contains bindings to external (numeric) libraries (that
is: extenal to boost) such as BLAS, LAPACK, CBLAS and AMOS. These bindings
can be used for uBlas vectors and matrices, std::vector, boost::array etc.

<h3>Traits</h3>
The traits module contains traits classes (what else;) for obtaining a pointer
to the storage, the size, stride and leading dimension of a vector and matrix.
The file traits.hpp contains a default trait that can be used. For applying
these traits however on e.g. ublas matrices, you also need to include
ublas_matrix.hpp.

<h3>Amos</h3>

<h3>Blas</h3>
