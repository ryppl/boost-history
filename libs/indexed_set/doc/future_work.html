<p>
A number of new functionalities are considered for inclusion into
future releases of Boost.IndexedSet. Some of them depend on the
potential for extensibility of the library, which has been a guiding
principle driving the current internal design of <code>indexed_set</code>.

<h2><a name="hashed_indices">Hashed indices</a></h2>

<p>
Several STL implementations feature hashed sets as a natural
counterpart to <code>std::set</code> and <code>std::multiset</code>.
<code>indexed_set</code> can also benefit from the inclusion of hashed
indices. As the exact details of the interfaces of hashed sets differ among
library vendors, a good starting point seems Matt Austern's paper
<a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1456.html">A
Proposal to Add Hash Tables to the Standard Library (revision 4)</a>, which
has been submitted for acceptance into the next revision of the
C++ standard.
</p>

<h2><a name="sentries">Sentries</a></h2>

<p>
A <i>sentry index</i> can be thought of as a void index whose only
purpose is to receive events from the enclosing <code>indexed_set</code>
(insertion, erasing, modifying of elements) and signal them to an
external entity --for instance, by means of the
<a href="../../../doc/html/signals.html">Boost.Signals</a>
library. This special type of index can have applications for:
<ol>
  <li>Logging,</li>
  <li>interfacing to GUI-based applications,</lu>
  <li>synchronization between separate data structures.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2><a name="user_defined_indices">User-defined indices</a></h2>

<p>
The mechanisms by which Boost.IndexedSet orchestrates the
operations of the indices held by an <code>indexed_set</code> are
simple enough to make them worth documenting so that the (bold)
user can write implementations for her own indices.
</p>

<h2><a name="indexed_maps">Indexed maps</a></h2>

<p>
<code>indexed_set</code> is rich enough to provide the basis
for implementation of <i>indexed maps</i>, i.e. maps which
can be looked upon several different keys. The motivation for having
such a container is mainly aesthetic convenience, since it
would not provide any additional feature to similar constructs
based directly on <code>indexed_set</code>.
</p>

<p>
The main challenge in writing an indexed map lies in the design of a
reasonable interface that resembles that of <code>std::map</code> as
much as possible. There seem to be fundamental difficulties in extending
the syntax of a <code>std::map</code> to multiple keys. For one example,
consider the situation:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<span class=identifier>indexed_map</span><span class=special>&lt;</span><span class=keyword>int</span><span class=special>,</span><span class=identifier>string</span><span class=special>,</span><span class=keyword>double</span><span class=special>&gt;</span> <span class=identifier>m</span><span class=special>;</span>
<span class=comment>// keys are int and string, double is the mapped to value</span>

<span class=special>...</span>

<span class=identifier>cout</span><span class=special>&lt;&lt;</span><span class=identifier>m</span><span class=special>[</span><span class=number>0</span><span class=special>]&lt;&lt;</span><span class=identifier>endl</span><span class=special>;</span>      <span class=comment>// OK</span>
<span class=identifier>cout</span><span class=special>&lt;&lt;</span><span class=identifier>m</span><span class=special>[</span><span class=string>&quot;zero&quot;</span><span class=special>]&lt;&lt;</span><span class=identifier>endl</span><span class=special>;</span> <span class=comment>// OK</span>
<span class=identifier>m</span><span class=special>[</span><span class=number>1</span><span class=special>]=</span><span class=number>1.0</span><span class=special>;</span>              <span class=comment>// !!</span>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In the last sentence of the example, the user has no way of
providing the <code>string</code> key mapping to the same value
as <code>m[1]</code>. This and similar problems have to be devoted
a careful study when designing the interface of a potential
indexed map.
</p>

<h2><a name="serialization">Serialization support</a></h2>

<p>
Once <a href="http://www.rrsd.com/boost/index.htm">Robert Ramey's
serialization library</a> gets accepted into Boost, support for
archiving/retrieving <code>indexed_set</code>s should be added.
</p>

<h2><a name="mojo">Mojoing <code>indexed_set</code></a></h2>

<p>
Andrei Alexandrescu introduced a technique for simulating move
constructors called Mojo (see his article in C/C++ User Journal
<a href="http://www.cuj.com/documents/s=8246/cujcexp2102alexandr/">
"Generic&lt;Programming>: Move Constructors"</a>.) Mojo alleviates the
computational load involved in the creation and copying of temporary
objects, specially for heavy classes as <code>indexed_set</code>s are.
</p>

<p>
A mojoed <code>indexed_set</code> is seen as particularly useful when used
as an internal building block in other libraries (vg. relational
database frameworks), enabling the efficient development of functions
returning <code>indexed_set</code>s. Without mojoing, this scheme
is impractical and less elegant syntaxes should be resorted to.
