<p>
Fernando Cacciola, Darren Cook, Beman Dawes, Jeremy Maitin-Shepard and Daryle
Walker from the Boost mailing list provided useful suggestions for improvement
on the first alpha releases of the library. Gang Wang discovered several
bugs in the code.
</p>

<p>
Pavel Vo&#382;en&iacute;lek has been immensely helpful in thoroughly reviewing
every single bit of the library, and he also suggested several extra
functionalities, most notably range querying, safe mode and polymorphic key
extractors. Thank you!

Boost.IndexedSet could not have been written without Aleksey Gurtovoy
et. al. superb <a href="../../../libs/mpl/doc/index.html">Boost MPL
Library</a>. Also, Aleksey's techniques for dealing with ETI-related
problems in MSVC++ 6.0 helped solve some internal issues of the library.
