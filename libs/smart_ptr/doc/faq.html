    <h2><a name="question1"></a>1. How does this library relate to the existing 
      <a href="../../../libs/smart_ptr/index.htm">boost::smart_ptr</a> library?</h2>
    <p>While this is a political hot-button issue, the simple answer is: peaceful co-existence.
    That is, it seems likely that if this library is accepted into Boost, both libraries will 
    continue to be a part of Boost until a compelling reason to do otherwise is presented.  Is
    there overlap?  Yes.  Is this bad?  Not necessarily.  For more rationale, see the other
    FAQs.</p>
    <h2><a name="question2"></a>2. Why do we need YASP (Yet Another Smart Pointer)?</h2>
    <p>Because no smart pointer is optimal in every situation.  While the constellation of
    current Boost smart pointers satisfy a large number of use cases, they have grown over
    time to accomodate more and more situations.  The policy-based design of this library is
    intended to provide a central framework whereby any desired smart pointer can be 
    assembled in a straightforward, safe, and reliable way.</p>
    <h2><a name="question3"></a>3. What are the advantages of policy-based design?</h2>
    <p>Policy-based design allows one to reuse the parts of a smart pointer that are common
    while adding features that are not.  Different checking policies can be defined to give
    different levels of security, while novel ownership policies can be created to handle
    resources in unique ways.  While each policy combination creates a unique type, the types
    may be related through an inheritance graph.  Thus, it is possible to make the types
    aware of each other and interoperate accordingly.  Furthermore, the high level of
    customization allows for maximal efficiency.  Only the necessary functionality need be
    included in any given type.  This allows for small pointers, fast pointers, and everything
    in between.</p>
    <h2><a name="question4"></a>4. What are the disadvantages of policy-based design?</h2>
    <p>Two major criticisms of policy-based design are noted here: Interoperability, and
    Simplicity.  Even though policy-based design unifies smart pointers into a common
    framework, it is true that it tends to encourage type proliferation.  Thus, it may
    make it more difficult for users to agree on which type to pass between module or
    library boundaries.  Monolithic types tend to combine more features into fewer
    pointers, leading to easier interoperability.  Furthermore, policy-based smart
    pointers can be complicated to specify.  There are several template parameters
    that can be specified, and this could lead to confusion among users.  This is alleviated
    somewhat by the use of type generators, and could be alleviated further if
    template typedefs were added to the language.</p>
