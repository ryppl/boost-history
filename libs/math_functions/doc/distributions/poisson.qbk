well-[section:poisson_dist Poisson]

The [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution Poisson distribution]
is a well-known statistical discrete distribution.
It expresses the probability of a number of events
(or failures, arrivals, occurrences ...)
occurring in a fixed period of time,
provided these events occur with a known mean rate __lambda __space
(events/time), 
and are independent of the time since the last event.

The distribution was discovered by Sim__eacute on-Denis Poisson (1781 to 1840).

``#include <boost/math/distributions/poisson.hpp>``
  namespace boost { namespace math {
  
	template <class RealType = double>
	class poisson_distribution;

	typedef poisson_distribution<double> poisson;

  template <class RealType>
	class poisson_distribution
	{ 
	public:
	  poisson_distribution(RealType mean = 1); // Constructor.
	  RealType mean()const;	// Accessor.
	}
  }} // namespaces boost::math
   
[h4 Member Functions]

   poisson_distribution(RealType mean = 1);
   
Constructs a poisson distribution with mean /mean/.

   RealType mean()const;
   
Returns the /mean/ of this distribution.
   
[h4 Non-member Accessors]

All the [link math_toolkit.dist.dist_ref.nmp usual non-member accessor functions] that are generic to all
distributions are supported: __usual_accessors.

[h4 Accuracy]

The poisson distribution is implemented in terms of the 
[link math_toolkit.special.igamma gamma_P gamma function] and
[link math_toolkit.special.igamma gamma_Q complement], 
and as such should have low error rates.
Quantile and complement use the inverse gamma functions
and are therefore probably less accurate.
This is because the inverse gamma functions are
implemented using an iterative method with a lower tolerance
to avoid excessive computation.

[h4 Implementation]

In the following table __lambda  is the mean of the distribution.

[table
[[Function][Implementation Notes]]
[[pdf][Using the relation: pdf = e[super -__lambda] __lambda[super k] \/ k! ]]
[[cdf][Using the relation: p = __Gamma(k+1, __lambda) \/ k! using gamma\_Q(k+1, __lambda)]]
[[cdf complement][Using the relation: gamma\_Q(k+1, __lambda) ]]
[[quantile][Using the relation: gamma_Q\_inva(__lambda, p) -1]]
[[quantile from the complement][Using the relation: gamma\_P\_inva(__lambda, q) -1]]
[[mean][__lambda]]
[[mode][floor (__lambda) or __floorL __lambda __floorR]]
[[skewness][1/sqrt(__lambda)]]
[[kurtosis][3 + 1/__lambda]]
