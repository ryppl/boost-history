[h4 Synopsis]

``
#include <boost/math/special_functions/gamma.hpp>
``

   namespace boost{ namespace math{
   
   template <class T>
   T lgamma(T z);
   
   template <class T>
   T lgamma(T z, int* sign);
   
   }} // namespaces

[h4 Description]

The [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function lgamma function] is defined by:

[$../equations/lgamm1.png]

The second form of the function takes a pointer to an integer,
which if non-null is set on output to the sign of tgamma(z).

[$../graphs/lgamma.png]

There are effectively two versions of this function internally: a fully
generic version that is slow, but reasonably accurate, and a much more
efficient approximation that is used where the number of digits in the mantissa
of T correspond to a certain __lanczos.  In practice, any built-in
floating-point type you will encounter has an appropriate __lanczos
defined for it.  It is also possible, given enough machine time, to generate
further __lanczos's using the program libs/math/tools/lanczos_generator.cpp.

[h4 Accuracy]

The following table shows the peak errors (in units of epsilon) 
found on various platforms
with various floating point types. Unless otherwise specified any
floating point type that is narrower than the one shown will have
__zero_error.

[h4 Testing]

The main tests for this function involve comparisons against the logs of 
the factorials which can be independently calculated to very high accuracy.

Random tests in key problem areas are also used.

[h4 Implementation]

The generic version of this function is implemented by combining the series and 
continued fraction representations for the incomplete gamma function:

[$../equations/lgamm2.png]

where /l/ is an arbitrary integration limit: choosing [^l = max(10, a)] 
seems to work fairly well.  For negative /z/ the logarithm version of the 
reflection formula is used:

[$../equations/lgamm3.png]

For types of known precision, the __lanczos is used, a traits class 
`boost::math::lanczos::lanczos_traits` maps type T to an appropriate
approximation.  The logarithmic version of the __lanczos is:

[$../equations/lgamm4.png]

As before the reflection formula is used for /z < 0/.

When z is very near 1 or 2, then the logarithmic version of the __lanczos
suffers very badly from cancellation error: indeed for values sufficiently
close to 1 or 2, arbitrarily large relative errors can be obtained (even though
the absolute error is tiny).  The current solution is as follows: imagine we
balance the two terms in the __lanczos by dividing the power term by its value
at /z = 1/, and then multiplying the Lanczos coefficients by the same value.
Now each term will take the value 1 at /z = 1/ and we can rearrange the power terms
in terms of log1p.  Likewise if we subtract 1 from the Lanczos sum part 
(algebraically, by subtracting the value of each term at /z = 1/), we obtain
a new summation that can be also be fed into log1p.  Crucially, all of the 
terms tend to zero, as /z -> 1/:

[$../equations/lgamm5.png]

The Ck terms in the above are the same as in the __lanczos.

A similar rearrangement can be performed at /z = 2/:
