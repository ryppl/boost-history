[section:inv_hyper_over Inverse Hyperbolic Functions Overview]

The exponential funtion is defined, for all object for which this makes sense, 
as the power series 
[$../equations/special_functions_blurb1.jpeg], 
with ['[^n! = 1x2x3x4x5...xn]] (and ['[^0! = 1]] by definition) being the factorial of ['[^n]]. 
In particular, the exponential function is well defined for real numbers, 
complex number, quaternions, octonions, and matrices of complex numbers, 
among others.

The hyperbolic functions are defined as power series which 
can be computed (for reals, complex, quaternions and octonions) as:

Hyperbolic cosine: [$../equations/special_functions_blurb5.jpeg]

Hyperbolic sine: [$../equations/special_functions_blurb6.jpeg]

Hyperbolic tangent: [$../equations/special_functions_blurb7.jpeg]

[: [$../graphs/trigonometric.png]]

[: ['[*Hyperbolic functions on r (cosh: purple; sinh: red; tanh: blue)]]]
[: [$../graphs/hyperbolic.png]]

The hyperbolic sine is one to one on the set of real numbers, 
with range the full set of reals, while the hyperbolic tangent is 
also one to one on the set of real numbers but with range __form1, and 
therefore both have inverses. The hyperbolic cosine is one to one from __form2 
onto __form3 (and from __form4 onto __form3); the inverse function we use 
here is defined on __form3 with range __form2.

The inverse of the hyperbolic tangent is called the Argument hyperbolic tangent, 
and can be computed as [$../equations/special_functions_blurb15.jpeg].

The inverse of the hyperbolic sine is called the Argument hyperbolic sine, 
and can be computed (for __form5) as [$../equations/special_functions_blurb17.jpeg].

The inverse of the hyperbolic cosine is called the Argument hyperbolic cosine, 
and can be computed as [$../equations/special_functions_blurb18.jpeg].

[section:acosh acosh]

``
#include <boost/math/special_functions/acosh.hpp>
``

   template<typename T> 
   T acosh(const T x);

Computes the reciprocal of (the restriction to the range of __form1) 
[link math_toolkit.special.inv_hyper.inv_hyper_over
the hyperbolic cosine function], at x. Values returned are positive. Generalised 
Taylor series are used near 1 and Laurent series are used near the 
infinity to ensure accuracy.

If x is in the range __form2 then returns the result of __domain_error.

[section:asinh asinh]

``
#include <boost/math/special_functions/asinh.hpp>
``

   template<typename T> 
   T asinh(const T x);

Computes the reciprocal of 
[link math_toolkit.special.inv_hyper.inv_hyper_over 
the hyperbolic sine function]. 
Taylor series are used at the origin and Laurent series are used near the 
infinity to ensure accuracy.

[endsect]

[section:atanh atanh]

``
#include <boost/math/special_functions/atanh.hpp>
``

   template<typename T> 
   T atanh(const T x);

Computes the reciprocal of 
[link math_toolkit.special.inv_hyper.inv_hyper_over
the hyperbolic tangent function], at x. 
Taylor series are used at the origin to ensure accuracy.

If x is in the range 
__form3
or in the range 
__form4
then returns the result of __domain_error.

If x is in the range 
__form5, 
then the result of -__overflow_error is returned, with 
__form6[space]
denoting numeric_limits<T>::epsilon().

If x is in the range 
__form7, 
then the result of __overflow_error is returned, with 
__form6[space]
denoting 
numeric_limits<T>::epsilon().
