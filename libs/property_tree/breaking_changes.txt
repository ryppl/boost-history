List all breaking changes done to the interface during the update here.

- Template parameters
Template parameters have been thoroughly changed.
Impact: If you were using a custom instantiation of basic_ptree, you have to
  change your code.

- put*
The put and put_child functions of basic_ptree had add and add_child split from
them, by splitting the functionality of the third parameter.
Impact: If you were using the third parameter of these functions, you have to
  change your code.

- Custom paths
Custom paths have been thoroughly changed.
Impact: If you were using custom paths, you have to change your code. If you
  referred to the basic_path template by name, you have to change your code.

- Translators
Translators have been thoroughly changed.
Impact: If you were using translators at all, you probably have to change your
  code.

- find
find() returns an assoc_iterator.
Impact: If you use find, you may have to change your code.
Rationale: equal_range() also returns assoc_iterators.
