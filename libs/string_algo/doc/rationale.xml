            When designing a library there is always a problem to find a balance between generalization
            and usability. Generic utility can have wider range of usage with more options to extensibility,
            but it can also bring unwanted overhead for everyday usage.

            Imagine a library for drawing geometric objects. It can contain one generic function draw(),
            with many parameters specifying what to draw, like size, number of edges, shape etc.
            This would allow you to draw almost anything, but when a user usually needs to draw 
            only a triangle, or a square, she will have to specify this simple request in a 
            very complicated way. Therefore, for this purpose, two functions, draw_triangle() and
            draw_square() would suit much better then a generic draw() function.

            String Algorithm Library solves this problem by dividing the interface into layers.
            First layer (defined in the namespace boost) contains ready to use algorithms specialized
            for common tasks. They are provided in multiple variant, to better suit the specific needs.
            Second layer (defined in the namespace boost::string_algo), provides generic interface with
            more options for extending and tunning.

            For instance, a <functionname>boost::trim</functionname> algorithm trims spaces from 
            an input string. When there is a need to trim something else, there is 
            <functionname>boost::string_algo::trim</functionname>. Its interface allow to specify a 
            predicate which selects the characters to be removed.
        </para>

    <section it="string_algo.locale">
        <title>Locales</title>

        <para>
            Locales have a very close relation to string processing. They contain information about
            the character sets. Locales are used, for example, to change the case of characters,
            to classify the characters and etc. 
        </para>
        <para>
            C++ allows to work with multiple different instances of locales at once. If an algorithm
            manipulates some data in a way that requires the usage of locales, there must be a way
            to specify them. However, one instance of locales is sufficient for most of the applications,
            and for a user it could be very tedious to specify which locales should be used on every place 
            where it is needed. 
        </para> 
        <para>
            Fortunately, C++ standard allows to specify the "global" locales (using static member
            function <code>std:locale::global()</code>). When instantiating 
            <code>std::locale</code> class without explicit information, the instance will 
            be initialized with "global" locales. It means, that if an algorithm needs some locales,
            it should have a <code>std::locale</code> parameter with default value <code>std::locale()</code>.
            If a user needs to specify locales explicitly, she can do so. Otherwise the "global"
            locales are used.
        </para>

    <section id="string_algo.regex">
        <title>Regular Expressions</title>

        <para>
            Regular expressions are essential part of text processing. For this reason, the library 
            provides also regex variants of some algorithms. The library does not try to replace
            <libraryname>Boost.Regex</libraryname>. It merely wraps its functionality in a new interface.
            As a part of this library regex algorithms integrate smoothly with other components, thus 
            bringing additional value.
