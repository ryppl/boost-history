  <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>
    The String Algorithm Library provides a generic implementation of various
    string-related algorithms which are missing in STL. It&nbsp;is an extension
    to the algorithms library of STL. Algorithms in this library include
    trimming, case conversion, predicates and find/replace functions. All of
    them come in different variants so it is easier to choose the best fit for a
    particular need.
  </p>
  <p>
    The implementation is not restricted to work with a particular container (
    like a <code>std::basic_string</code> ), rather it is as generic as
    possible. This generalization is not compromising the performance since
    algorithms are using container specific features when it means a performance
    gain.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library also provides a good foundation for generic replace like
    transformations and searching. Core library algorithms are functor based to
    be easily customizable. Users can provide an implementation to fit their
    specific needs. An example of such a customization is regex part of the
    library ( see <a href="../../../boost/string_algo/regex.hpp">&lt;boost/string_algo/regex.hpp&gt;</a>
    ) and RLE compression example ( see <a href="../example/rle_example.cpp">&lt;libs/string_algo/example/rle_example.cpp&gt;</a>
    )
  </p>
  <h2><a name="reference">Reference</a></h2>
  <p>
    The library is organized into several parts and each part deals with a
    different set of problems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="trim.html">Trim</a> facility provides algorithms for removing
      trailing and leading spaces from sequences.</li>
    <li><a href="conv.html">Case conversion</a> facility contains sequence
      variants for <code>std::toupper</code> and <code>std::tolower</code>
      algorithms.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">
        <a href="predicate.html">Predicates</a> facility includes some popular
        string related predicates like <code>starts_with</code>, <code>contains</code>
        and etc.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">
        <a href="find.html">Find</a> facility provides a set of algorithms for
        searching for a substring within a sequence.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">
        <a href="replace.html">Replace/Erase</a> facility contains various
        search and replace algorithms for sequences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Every component is provided in separate header. The library contains two
    cumulative headers for convenience. <a href="../../../boost/string_algo.hpp">&lt;boost/string_algo.hpp&gt;</a>
    contain all components except regex related ones. <a
    href="../../../boost/string_algo_regex.hpp">&lt;boost/string_algo_regex.hpp&gt;</a>
    includes also regex algorithms.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="build">Build</a></h2>
  <p>
    Whole library is provided in headers. Regex variants of some algorithms,
    however, are dependant on the <a
    href="http://www.boost.org/libs/regex/index.htm">Regex++ library</a>. All
    such algorithms are separated in <a
    href="../../../boost/string_algo/regex.hpp">&lt;boost/string_algo/regex.hpp&gt;</a>
    . If this header is used, an application must be linked with the Regex++
    library.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="portability">Portability</a></h2>
  <p>
    Library has been successfully compiled and tested with Microsoft Visual C++
    7.0 and GCC 3.2.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are known limitation on platforms not supporting partial template
    specialization. Library depends on correctly implemented <code>std::iterator_traits</code>
    class. If a standard library provided with compiler is broken, the String
    Algorithm Library cannot function properly. Usually it implies, that
    primitive pointer iterators are not working.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="copy_mutable">Copy vs. Mutable</a></h3>
  <p>
    Many algorithms in the library are performing a transformation of the input.
    Transformation can be done in-place, mutating the input sequence, or a copy
    of the transformed input can be created, leaving the input intact. None of
    these possibilities is superior to the other one and both have different
    advantages and disadvantages. For this reason, both are provided with the
    library.
  </p>
  <p>
    Copy versions return a transformed input as a result. Mutable variants
    return a reference to the input. Thus both versions allow a simple chaining
    of transformations within one expression ( i.e. one can write <code>trim_copy(toupper_copy(s))</code>
    as well as <code>trim(toupper(s))</code> ).
  </p>
  <h3><a name="naming">Naming</a></h3>
  <p>
    Naming follows the conventions from the Standard C++ Library. If there is a
    copy and mutable version of the same algorithm,<br>
    the mutable version has no suffix and the copy version has suffix <code>_copy</code>.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="regex">Regex</a></h3>
  <p>
    Regular expressions are essential part of text processing. For this reason,
    the library provides also regex variants of algorithms. In some places they
    copy a functionality from the Regex++ library. The goal was to provide
    complete unified interface for all relevant algorithms in the library.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="ack">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
        
    <!--        
		<p>Many algorithms in this library are implemented using 2 layer structure. There 
			is a generic algorithm in the bottom layer, which is highly paramertic and so 
			not very well suited for general usage. The second layer consist of various 
			specializations for a given algorithm. An example is <code>replace()</code> algorithm. 
			The generic version of <code>replace()</code> accepts a <em>find</em> and <em>format</em>
			functors as a parameters. The library contains an implementaion of several 
			functors which can be used in this place. <code>replace_first()</code> as a 
			second layer algorithm is a simple wrapper around <code>replace</code> that 
			instantiates <code>find_firstF</code> functor and calls a generic version of 
			the <code>replace()</code> to do the job.
