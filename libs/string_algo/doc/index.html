  <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>
    The String Algorithm Library provides a generic implementation of various
    string-related algorithms which are missing in STL. It&nbsp;is an extension
    to the algorithms library of STL. Algorithms in this library include
    trimming, case conversion, predicates and find/replace routines. All of them
    come in different variants so it is easier to choose the best fit for a
    current need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation is not restricted to a particular container ( like a <code>std::basic_string</code>
    ), rather it is as generic as possible. Generalization is not compromising
    the performance, algorithms are using container specific features when it
    means a performance gain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Library also provides a good foundation for generic replace like
    transformations and searching. Core library algorithms are functor based to
    be easily customizable. User can provide an implemenation to fit his
    specific needes. An example of such a customization is regex part of the
    library ( see <a href="../../../boost/string_algo/regex.hpp">&lt;boost/string_algo/regex.hpp&gt;</a>
    ) and RLE compression example ( see <a href="../example/rle_example.cpp">&lt;libs/string_algo/example/rle_example.cpp&gt;</a>
    )
  </p>
  <h2><a name="build">Build</a></h2>
  <p>
    Whole library is provided in headers. Regex variants of some algorithms,
    however, are dependant on the <a
    href="http://www.boost.org/libs/regex/index.htm">Regex++ library</a>. All
    such an algoritms are separated in <a
    href="../../../boost/string_algo/regex.hpp">&lt;boost/string_algo/regex.hpp&gt;</a>
    . If this header is used, an application must be linked to the Regex++
    library.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="portability">Portability</a></h2>
  <p>
    Library has been succesfully compiled and tested with Microsoft Visual C++
    7.0 and GCC 3.2.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="copy_mutable">Copy vs. Mutable</a></h3>
  <p>
    Many algorithms in the library are performing a transformation of the input.
    Transformation can be done in-place, mutating the input sequence, or a copy
    of the tranformated input can be created, leaving the input intact. None of
    these possibilities is supperior to the other, and both have different
    advantages and dissadvantages. For this reason, both are provided with the
    library.
  </p>
  <p>
    Copy versions return a transformed input as a result. Mutable variants
    return a reference to the input. This allows a simple chaining of
    transformations within one expression for both ( i.e one can write <code>trim_copy(toupper_copy(s))</code>
    as well as <code>trim(toupper(s))</code> )
  </p>
  <h3><a name="naming">Naming</a></h3>
  <p>
    Naming follows the conventions from the Standard C++ Library. If there is a
    copy and mutable version of the same algorithm,<br>
    mutable version is without suffix and copy version has suffix <code>_copy</code>.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="regex">Regex</a></h3>
  <p>
    Regulare expressions are essential part of text processing. For this reason,
    the library provides also regex variants of algorithms. In some places they
    copy a functionality from the Regex++ library. Goal was to provide complete
    unified interface for all relevant algorithms in the library.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="ack">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
        
    <!--        
		<p>Many algorithms in this library are implemented using 2 layer structure. There 
			is a generic algorithm in the bottom layer, which is highly paramertic and so 
			not very well suited for general usage. The second layer consist of various 
			specializations for a given algorithm. An example is <code>replace()</code> algorithm. 
			The generic version of <code>replace()</code> accepts a <em>find</em> and <em>format</em>
			functors as a parameters. The library contains an implementaion of several 
			functors which can be used in this place. <code>replace_first()</code> as a 
			second layer algorithm is a simple wrapper around <code>replace</code> that 
			instantiates <code>find_firstF</code> functor and calls a generic version of 
			the <code>replace()</code> to do the job.
