		The String Algorithm Library provides a generic implementation of various
		string-related algorithms which are missing in STL. It is an extension
		to the algorithms library of STL. Algorithms in this library include
		trimming, case conversion, predicates and find/replace functions. All of
		them come in different variants so it is easier to choose the best fit for a
		particular need.

	<para>
		The implementation is not restricted to work with a particular container 
		(like a <code>std::basic_string</code>), rather it is as generic as
		possible. This generalization is not compromising the performance since
		algorithms are using container specific features when it means a performance
		gain.

		The library has layered structure to simplify the usage without sacrificing the
		generalization. 

		Common interface, defined in the namespace <code>boost</code>, represents the first layer. 
		Algorithms and classes defined here, do not offer a lot of customization opportunities, 
		rather they are provided in more different variants, so an user can chose the 
		one that suites her needs.

		The second layer, defined in the namespace <code>boost::string_algo</code>, on the 
		other hand, is generic. Basicaly it contains the same set of algorithms as the first layer,
		but the interface is more flexible, allows more customization, but it is harder to use.

		The first layer is basicaly a set of wrappers around the second layer for the most common use cases.
