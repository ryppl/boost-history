[section:buckets The Data Structure]

The containers are made up of a number of 'buckets', each of which can contain
any number of elements. For example, the following diagram shows an [classref
boost::unordered_set unordered_set] with 7 buckets containing 5 elements, `A`,
`B`, `C`, `D` and `E` (this is just for illustration, containers will typically
have more buckets).

[$../../libs/unordered/doc/diagrams/buckets.png]

In order to decide which bucket to place an element in, the container applies
the hash function, `Hash`, to the element's key (for `unordered_set` and
`unordered_multiset` the key is the whole element, but is referred to as the key
so that the same terminology can be used for sets and maps). This returns a
value of type `std::size_t`.  `std::size_t` has a much greater range of values
then the number of buckets, so that container applies another transformation to
that value to choose a bucket to place the element in.

Retreiving the elements for a given key is simple. The same process is applied
to the key to find the correct bucket. Then the key is compared with the
elements in the bucket to find any elements that match.  If the hash
function has worked well the elements will be evenly distributed amongst the
buckets so only a small number of elements will need to be examined.

You can see in the diagram that `A` & `D` have been placed in the same bucket.
When looking for elements in this bucket up to 2 comparisons are made, making
the search slower. This is known as a collision. To keep things fast we try to
keep collisions to a minimum.

[h2 Controlling the number of buckets]

As more elements are added to an unordered associative container, the number
of elements in the buckets will increase causing performance to get worse. To
combat this the containers increase the bucket count as elements are inserted.

The standard gives you two methods to influence the bucket count. First you can
specify the minimum number of buckets in the constructor, and later, by calling
`rehash`.

The other method is the `max_load_factor` member function. The 'load factor'
is the average number of elements per bucket, `max_load_factor` can be used
to give a /hint/ of a value that the load factor should be kept below. The
draft standard doesn't actually require the container to pay much attention
to this value. The only time the load factor is /required/ to be less than the
maximum is following a call to `rehash`. But most implementations will probably
try to keep the number of elements below the max load factor, and set the
maximum load factor something the same or near to your hint - unless your hint
is unreasonably small.

It is not specified anywhere how member functions other than `rehash` affect
the bucket count, although `insert` is only allowed to invalidate iterators
when the insertion causes the load factor to reach the maximum. Which will
typically mean that insert will only change the number of buckets when an
insert causes this.

In a similar manner to using `reserve` for `vector`s, it can be a good idea
to call `rehash` before inserting a large number of elements. This will get
the expensive rehashing out of the way and let you store iterators, safe in
the knowledge that they won't be invalidated. If you are inserting `n`
elements into container `x`, you could first call:

    x.rehash((x.size() + n) / x.max_load_factor() + 1);

[blurb Note: `rehash`'s argument is the number of buckets, not the number of
elements, which is why the new size is divided by the maximum load factor.  The
+ 1 guarantees there is no invalidation; without it, reallocation could occur
if the number of bucket exactly divides the target size, since the container is
allowed to rehash when the load factor is equal to the maximum load factor.]
