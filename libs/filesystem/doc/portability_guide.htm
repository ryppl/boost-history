Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Like any other C++ program which performs I/O operations, there is no 
guarantee that a program using the Filesystem Library will be portable between 
operating systems. The file and directory names in paths present a particularly 
troublesome portability problem.</p>
<p>Although there is no way to guarantee that a path is portable to every 
operating system, the probability of portability can be markedly improved by 
understanding the limits imposed by various operating systems, and by following 
some rules-of-thumb when deciding path issues.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><strong>Recommendation</strong></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Limit file and directory names to the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, period, hyphen, and
    underscore.<br>
    <br>
    For even greater portability, don't use hyphens at all.</td>
    <td valign="top">These are the characters specified by the POSIX standard for portable directory and
    file names, and are also valid for Windows, Mac, and many other modern filesystems. 
    ISO-9660, and possibly some legacy systems, do not permit hyphens at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Do not use periods in directory names. </td>
    <td valign="top">Requirement for Requirement for ISO-9660, OpenVMS native 
    filesystem, and other legacy systems.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Do not use more that one period in a file name.</td>
    <td valign="top">Requirement for ISO-9660, OpenVMS native filesystem, and 
    other legacy systems. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Do not use period, hyphen, or underscore as the first 
    character of a file or directory name.</td>
    <td valign="top">Some operating systems treat have special rules for the 
    first character of names. POSIX, for example.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Do not assume names are case sensitive. For example, do not expected a directory to be
    able to hold separate elements named &quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;foo&quot;. </td>
    <td valign="top">Some filesystems are case insensitive.&nbsp; For example, Windows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Do not assume names are case insensitive.&nbsp; For example, do not expect a file
    created with the name of &quot;Foo&quot; to be open successfully with the name of &quot;foo&quot;.</td>
    <td valign="top">Some filesystems are case sensitive.&nbsp; For example, POSIX.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Limit the length of names and the depth of the directory 
    tree so that the total length of the string returned by generic_path() to 
    255 characters.&nbsp; 
    Note that ISO 9660 level 1 has an explicit directory tree depth limit of 8.</td>
    <td valign="top">Some operating systems place limits on the total path length.&nbsp; For example,
    Windows 2000 limits paths to 260 characters total length.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Limit the length of any one name in a path.&nbsp; Pick the specific limit according to
    the operating systems you wish portability to:<br>
    &nbsp; Greater than 31 characters:&nbsp; POSIX, Windows, MAC OS X.<br>
    &nbsp; 31 characters: Classic Mac OS<br>
&nbsp; 8 characters + period + 3 characters: ISO 9660 (CD-ROM)<br>
    <strong>...</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Limiting name length can markedly reduce the expressiveness of file names, yet placing
    only very high limits on lengths inhibits wide portability.</td>
  </tr>
