<a name="shmem.growing_limitation"></a> Memory growth Limitation</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
Shmem wants to be portable across multiple operating systems
so that it can not count with an operating systems that maps shared
memory to the same base address in all processes in the system,
although it provides a way to map the shared memory in the same
base address.</p>
<p>
However, without this capability, it is quite complicated to
design a growing shared memory allocator, one that allocates
new shared memory segments when a segment is full of objects.
For this reason, this first version of this library will be
limited to a shared memory segment, and its size must be
calculated beforehand by the user. If there is no more
memory, an exception will be thrown. This is very performance
friendly, but it is also a limiting factor. In near future, there
is a plan to add growing capacity to Shmem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="shmem.stl_limitation"></a> Problems with most STL implementations</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
Since Shmem does not count with same mapping address in
different processes for the same shared memory segment, it
must use a new, offset containing smart pointer. Many STL 
container implementations, suppose that
allocator::pointer type is a raw pointer, so they do not
allow Shmem allocators to be used in those containers. Currently, I 
am not aware of any STL implementation that works with this smart 
pointer approach. Dinkumware STL from Visual .NET 2003 is very
close, but fails in some instantiations. libstdc++ and STLPort
use directly raw pointers in containers, and they don't pay 
attention to this allocator::pointer type. This is likely 
to change soon, as soon as containers start using allocators 
with pointer types different from T*.</p>
<p>
To solve this, Shmem provides some STL compliant
containers, that are ready to use with shared memory. 
These implementations, valid for both normal 
(std::)allocator and shared memory allocator, 
implement the techniques described in the
<a href="containers_explained.html#shmem.stl_container_requirements" title=" Container requirements for Shmem allocators">"Container requirements for Shmem allocators"</a>
section.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="shmem.offset_pointer"></a> Offset pointers instead of raw pointers</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
When placing objects in shared memory and mapping
that memory in different segments in different processes,
raw pointers are a problem since they are only valid for
the process that placed them there. To solve this, Shmem offers
an offset pointer that can be used instead of a raw pointer.</p>
<p>
But user classes containing raw pointers (or Boost smart pointers, that 
internally own a raw pointer) can't be safely placed in shared memory. 
These pointers must be replaced with offset pointers, and these
pointers must point only to objects placed in the same memory
segment if you want to use these shared objects from different processes.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="shmem.references_forbidden"></a> References forbidden</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
References suffer from the same problem as pointers 
(mainly because they are implemented as pointers).
However, it is not possible to create a fully workable 
smart reference currently in C++(for example,
"operator dot" can't be overloaded). Because of this,
if the user wants to put an object in shared memory, 
the object can't have any member (smart or not) reference.</p>
<p>
References will only work if memory is mapped in the same
base address in all processes sharing a memory segment.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="shmem.virtuality_limitation"></a> Virtuality forbidden</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
This is not an specific problem of Shmem, it is a problem
for all shared memory object placing mechanisms.
The virtual table pointer and the virtual table
are in the address space of the process
that constructs the object, so if we place a class
with virtual function or inheritance, the virtual
function pointer placed in shared memory will be
invalid for other processes.</p>
<p>
This problem would be very difficult to solve, since each process needs a 
different virtual table pointer and the object that contains tha pointer
is shared accross many processes.The virtual table pointer is the most 
common mechanism to implement virtual functions but it's implementation 
defined and can't be easily overwriten. Maybe even compiler help is needed 
for this. So Shmem does not have any plan to support virtual function and 
virtual inheritance in shared memory.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="shmem.statics_warning"></a> Be careful with static class members</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
Static members of classes are global objects shared by 
all instances of the class. Because of this, static
members are implemented as global variables in processes.</p>
<p>
When constructing a class with static members, each process
has its own copy of the static member, so updating a static
member in one process does not change the value the other 
process has. So be careful with these classes. Static members
are not dangerous if they are just constant variables initialized
when the process starts, but they don't change at all (for example,
when used like enums).</p>
