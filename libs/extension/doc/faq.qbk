[section:faq FAQ]

Question: What if I have multiple versions of the same interface (I've added new
member functions as they've become necessary), and I want to keep track of which
version is implemented by different plugins?
  
Answer: The simplest way is to change the name of your interface (or the 
namespace it is in) each time its contents change. This is actually what I would
recommend. However, it is also possible to include such information as part 
of the `factory`. A `factory` can contain arbitrary information about the plugin
that it loads through the Info type. In the `hello_world` sample, the `Info` 
type is an `int`, and the `hello` class has a number (it could be a version) of
1, and the `world` class has a version of 2. In the multiple_inheritance sample,
this type is a string. This will be detailed in greater detail in this 
documentation.

Question: What if I want to have a library close automatically when I've
destroyed all of the plugins in it?

Answer: Wait for the `registry` class - which is almost done. It will take care
of it. It is possible to do this with a `factory_map` currently, but the 
`registry` class will automate the process.
