[section:introduction Introduction]

The Boost.Extension library has been developed to ease the development of 
plugins and similar extensions to software. Classes can be made available from 
shared libraries and loaded by the application. 
 
Among others, the library has the following features:

* Multiple and virtual inheritance are supported
* Library users do not need to use any macros (besides those required by Windows for exported functions) 
* Only one external function required per shared library to export classes
* RTTI is used by default, but it is possible to use user-defined type identification
* Classes do not need to be modified to be loadable


This library is currently in development in preparation for a review for inclusion in the
Boost C++ Libraries. For ongoing status updates, check
