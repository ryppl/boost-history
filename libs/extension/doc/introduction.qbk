[section:introduction Introduction]
Wrappers for loading classes from linked libraries to extend the functionality 
of a program. Created to ease the creation of plugins.

The Boost.Extension library has been developed to ease the development of 
plugins and similar extensions to software. Classes can be made available from 
linked libraries and loaded automatically by the application. 
	
The documentation is completely incomplete. Sorry. Look at tutorial #1 for 
examples of basic usage, and tutorial #2 for examples of advanced usage.  
  
Note the following:



# Multiple and virtual inheritance are supported
# No macros are currently used (besides those required by Windows for exported functions) 
# Only one external function required per shared library to export classes
# RTTI is used by default, but it is possible to use user-defined type identifications.
# Classes do not need to be modified to be loadable
