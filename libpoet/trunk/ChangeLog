2008-06-17 09:32  fmhess

	* poet/: null_type.hpp, detail/nonvoid.hpp: Split poet::null_type

	  test/active_object_test.cpp, test/future_selector_test.cpp,
	  test/undead_active_function_test.cpp: Converted scheduler
	  entirely over to waiting on futures instead of relying on
	  completion signals.  Simplified method
	  requests/scheduler/active_function by throwing out less useful
	  features that were difficult to implement cleanly with the new
	  scheme (guard functions, manual polling of scheduler,

	  Added future_selector::size, reset, and swap.  Fixed logic bug in
	  future_selector::pop_selected.

2008-06-09 14:51  fmhess

	  poet/detail/future_barrier_template.hpp,
	  poet/detail/identity.hpp, test/future_waits_test.cpp: Added
	  ExceptionHandler parameter to future_combining_barrier, which
	  generates exception_ptr for returned future from exception_ptr of
	  input future.

2008-06-05 16:52  fmhess

	* poet/future_select.hpp, test/future_selector_test.cpp: Added new
	  test for future_selector regarding cancelling futures obtained
	  from a future_selector which no longer exists.  Made changes so
	  test passes.

2008-06-05 12:21  fmhess

	* poet/active_function.hpp, poet/active_object.hpp,
	  poet/exception_ptr.cpp, poet/future.hpp, poet/future_barrier.hpp,
	  poet/future_select.hpp, poet/detail/active_function_template.hpp,

	  test/active_object_test.cpp,
	  test/future_combining_barrier_test.cpp,
	  test/future_selector_test.cpp: Added support for future_selector.
	  Futures now execute all user callback code in future-waiting
	  threads (type conversions and combiners from
	  future_combining_barrier).  That means some futures are "lazy"
	  now, and will not emit their complete signals until waited
	  on/queried.

2008-06-03 10:25  fmhess

	* test/future_combining_barrier_test.cpp: Replaced convert with
	  identity.

	* poet/future.hpp, test/promise_count_test.cpp: Added
	  promise::has_future (not yet documented).

2008-05-29 10:41  fmhess

	* poet/future.hpp, poet/future_barrier.hpp, poet/future_select.hpp,
	  poet/detail/future_barrier_template.hpp, poet/detail/nonvoid.hpp,
	  test/future_waits_test.cpp: Renamed poet::bogus_void to
	  poet::null_type.  future_combining_barrier functions work now.
	  Dealt with explosion of friend classes to futures.

2008-05-28 21:31  fmhess

	* poet/detail/active_function_template.hpp: Fixed compile error
	  caused by last commit.

	  free functions that accept heterogeneous input futures
	  (untested).

2008-05-28 17:07  fmhess

	* poet/: future.hpp, future_barrier.hpp, future_select.hpp,
	  detail/nonvoid.hpp: Using empty bogus_void class as place holder
	  for values from future<void>, instead of using int.  Trying to
	  make some changes to handle future<void> specializations without
	  so much work.

2008-05-28 16:03  fmhess

	* poet/future.hpp, poet/future_barrier.hpp, poet/future_select.hpp,
	  poet/detail/nonvoid.hpp, test/future_waits_test.cpp:
	  future_combining_barrier_range seems to be working now.

	  doc/boostbook/libpoet_reference.xml, poet/future.hpp,
	  poet/future_barrier.hpp, poet/future_select.hpp,
	  poet/future_waits.hpp, poet/detail/future_barrier_template.hpp,
	  poet/detail/future_select_template.hpp,
	  poet/detail/future_waits_template.hpp: Split future_waits.hpp
	  into future_barrier.hpp and future_select.hpp.  Added beginnings
	  of support for future barrier which takes a combiner function to
	  return a non-void return value.

	* poet/future.hpp, poet/future_waits.hpp,
	  poet/detail/future_waits_template.hpp,
	  test/future_waits_test.cpp: Changed prototype of future_select to
	  take input future with a uniform type and return a future of the
	  same type, instead of accepting heterogeneous input futures and
	  returning a future<void>.  Also renamed future_barrier and
	  future_select overloads that accept iteratotors to avoid
	  ambiguous overload problems.	Still need to update documentation
	  to reflect changes.

2008-05-23 18:47  fmhess

	  mutex_grapher singleton in a monitor_ptr, accessible only though
	  mutex_grapher::scoped_lock objects.  Made default cycle handler
	  print out a message to stderr before aborting.

2007-12-04 15:59  fmhess

	* poet/detail/monitor_locks.hpp: Gave up on trying to clear
	  synchronizer's wait function on unlock for now, since it will
	  break with recursive mutexes.

2007-12-04 09:37  fmhess

	* poet/detail/monitor_locks.hpp: Crash cleanly (or whatever happens
	  when you try to call a null boost::function) if user code for a
	  monitor object attempts to wait() without being locked.  Fixed
	  comments describing monitor_locks.hpp.

2007-12-01 23:28  fmhess

	* poet/monitor.hpp: Simplified monitor/try_monitor/timed_monitor
	  implementation by realizing they can all use plain monitor_ptr.

2007-12-01 21:19  fmhess

	* poet/monitor.hpp: Split off poet::try_monitor and
	  poet::timed_monitor variants off from poet::monitor.

2007-12-01 18:56  fmhess

	* poet/detail/monitor_locks.hpp: Made monitor scoped locks keep
	  shared_ptr for value instead of raw pointer, to be safe agains
	  locks outliving the monitor_ptr they were made from.

2007-12-01 13:34  fmhess

	* doc/boostbook/active_object_hpp.xml, poet/active_object.hpp,
	  poet/detail/active_object.cpp: Reworked how
	  out_of_order_activation_queue works, so it scales better with
	  number of pending requests.

2007-11-30 17:54  fmhess

	* doc/boostbook/monitor_ptr_hpp.xml: Added documentation of
	  monitor_ptr::reset(), and for changes to one of the constructors.

2007-11-30 17:25  fmhess

	* doc/boostbook/: Makefile, libpoet_reference.xml, monitor_hpp.xml,
	  monitor_locks_hpp.xml, monitor_ptr_hpp.xml: Reworked docs for
	  scoped locks so they are closer to reality.  Added docs for
	  poet::monitor.

2007-11-30 17:05  fmhess

	* poet/: monitor.hpp, monitor_ptr.hpp, detail/monitor_locks.hpp:
	  Moved scoped locks into their own file
	  (detail/monitor_locks.hpp).  Fixed assignment to a
	  default-constructed monitor.	Made monitor assignment operator
	  and copy constructor take non-const references when copying from
	  other monitors, since they lock their arguments before copying
	  out their values.  Fixed crash in monitor_ptr::reset().  Added
	  conversion to bool for monitor_ptr.

2007-11-30 17:02  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_base.hpp: Made sure _syncer pointer is not disturbed
	  by assignments.

2007-11-30 10:53  fmhess

	* poet/monitor.hpp: Made poet::monitor provide scoped_try_lock and
	  scoped_timed_lock, it is now based off timed_monitor_ptr and used
	  boost::timed_mutex as its default mutex type.  The mutex type
	  must now be a model of the TimedMutex concept from Boost Thread.

2007-11-30 10:49  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_ptr.hpp: Fixed compile warning.

2007-11-30 09:57  fmhess

	* poet/monitor.hpp: Added poet::monitor, which stores the wrapped
	  object by value and does deep copies, instead of acting like a
	  smart pointer (as monitor_ptr does).	This implementation took
	  the quick and easy route of being based on monitor_ptr.

2007-11-30 09:38  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_ptr.hpp: Made constructors from raw pointers
	  template functions, to take advantage of cleverness of shared_ptr
	  constructors.  Added reset().  Made
	  monitor_ptr_scoped_lock::wait_function private.

2007-11-27 17:42  fmhess

	* doc/boostbook/monitor_ptr_hpp.xml: Updated monitor_ptr docs to
	  reflect recent additions/changes.

2007-11-27 13:43  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_ptr.hpp: Made scoped locks in monitor_ptr
	  noncopyable.	Added monitor_ptr::call_proxy which is a thin
	  wrapper around monitor_ptr::scoped_lock that makes it suitable
	  (that is, copyable) for return from the monitor_ptr member access
	  operator.  Fixed a mis-named constructor for timed_monitor_ptr.

2007-11-27 12:04  fmhess

	* poet/: monitor_ptr.hpp, detail/monitor_synchronizer.hpp: Added
	  scoped lock types to monitor_ptr, and try_monitor_ptr and
	  timed_monitor_ptr.  Scoped locks provide member access operator
	  and dereference operator.  Replaced monitor_call_proxy with
	  scoped lock (plan make scoped locks noncopyable and use
	  shared_ptr<scoped_lock> instead).  Had to replace weak_ptr to
	  scoped_lock in monitor_synchronizer to support different types of
	  scoped locks, since the current version of boost::condition
	  requires a lock object from boost.thread.

2007-11-27 11:50  fmhess

	* poet/acyclic_mutex.hpp: Made names of acyclic lock classes more
	  distinguished by adding "acyclic_" to the beginnings.

2007-11-26 14:21  fmhess

	* poet/acyclic_mutex.hpp: re-added some missing "typename"
	  keywords.

2007-11-26 14:13  fmhess

	* poet/acyclic_mutex.hpp: Actually, we do need to template acyclic
	  locks on underlying lock type.

2007-11-26 11:29  fmhess

	* poet/: monitor_base.hpp, monitor_ptr.hpp, mutex_grapher.hpp,
	  detail/monitor_base.ipp, detail/monitor_base_decl.hpp,
	  detail/mutex_grapher.ipp, detail/mutex_grapher_decl.hpp: Don't
	  need separate .hpp and _decl.hpp files.

2007-11-26 10:31  fmhess

	* poet/detail/: mutex_grapher.ipp, mutex_grapher_decl.hpp: Added
	  mutex_grapher::set_cycle_hander() and made default handler call
	  std::abort().

2007-11-26 10:14  fmhess

	* poet/acyclic_mutex.hpp: Fixed compile error.

2007-11-23 09:43  fmhess

	* poet/acyclic_mutex.hpp: acyclic lock types don't need Lock
	  template parameter.

2007-11-21 14:40  fmhess

	* poet/: acyclic_mutex.hpp, detail/acyclic_mutex_base.hpp,
	  detail/mutex_grapher_decl.hpp, detail/static_mutex.hpp,
	  detail/template_static.hpp: Replaced static_mutex with more
	  general template_static.  Included a skeleton implementation of
	  acyclic_mutex_base when ACYCLIC_MUTEX_NDEBUG is defined.

2007-11-21 11:47  fmhess

	* poet/: acyclic_mutex.hpp, mutex_grapher.hpp,
	  detail/acyclic_mutex_base.hpp, detail/mutex_grapher.ipp,
	  detail/mutex_grapher_decl.hpp, detail/static_mutex.hpp: Initial
	  pass at supporting mutexes which automatically detect lock-order
	  violations.

2007-11-21 11:01  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_ptr.hpp: Made monitor_ptr constructor from raw
	  pointer explicit.

2007-11-18 12:53  fmhess

	* poet/: monitor_ptr.hpp, detail/monitor_synchronizer.hpp: Fixed
	  bug where synchronizer's _current_lock would be wrong after
	  returning from a wait().

2007-11-18 12:20  fmhess

	* poet/detail/monitor_synchronizer_base.hpp: Removed obsolete file.

2007-11-15 11:39  fmhess

	* README, doc/boostbook/libpoet_doc.xml: Specify programming
	  language at the beginning of the docs.

	  libpoet_doc.xml, monitor_base_hpp.xml, monitor_ptr_hpp.xml: Added
	  a little to the descriptions of active_function and scheduler
	  classes.  Added links to example code in relevant class
	  descriptions.

2007-11-15 09:14  fmhess

	* doc/boostbook/: Makefile, libpoet_doc.xml, libpoet_reference.xml,
	  monitor_base_hpp.xml, monitor_ptr_hpp.xml: Added documentation
	  for monitor_base.

2007-11-14 10:32  fmhess

	* poet/: monitor_base.hpp, monitor_ptr.hpp,
	  detail/monitor_base.ipp, detail/monitor_base_decl.hpp,
	  detail/monitor_synchronizer.hpp,
	  detail/monitor_synchronizer_base.hpp: Added poet::monitor_ptr and
	  poet::monitor_base which support monitor objects.

2007-10-23 16:23  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_ptr.hpp: Added typedef for

	  locking done for operator->().

2007-10-23 10:49  fmhess

	* poet/monitor_ptr.hpp: Added monitor_ptr class.

2007-10-13 22:55  fmhess

	  invalid docbook.

2007-10-12 09:24  fmhess

	* poet/active_object.hpp: Added some missing 'inline's to prevent
	  multiple definition linker errors.

2007-09-20 13:30  tag v2007_09_20

2007-09-20 13:30  fmhess

	* doc/boostbook/libpoet_doc.xml: Updated boostbook version, since
	  we are using the new <access> tags.

2007-09-20 13:29  fmhess

	* README: Updated location of html docs, and removed mention of
	  doxygen.

2007-09-11 16:53  fmhess

	  exceptions that got dropped in the doxygen->boostbook transition.

2007-09-11 15:33  fmhess

	  its activation queue is empty.

2007-03-19 10:04  fmhess

	* poet/future.hpp, test/future_test.cpp: Removed future constructor
	  that takes a conversion function, as the same functionality is
