/// \mainpage gtl -- Geometry Template Library
/// The geometry template library is a Concepts based typesystem that implements that API and algorithms for a large number of planar (2D) geometry operations.  The primary algorithms provided by gtl are polygon set operations, so-called Booleans, such as polygon intersection and union.  There are three classes of Booleans and associated types, which are axis-parallel (Manhattan), 45-degree restricted and arbitrary angle polygon operations.  This is done because it is significantly more efficient to process geometry data when assumptions about whether it is axis-parallel or restricted to 45-degree can be made.
