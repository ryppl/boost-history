</p><h1>Polygon Library Design Overview</h1>

<p> 
<p>The Polygon library uses C++-Concepts inspired template programming to 
provide generic library functions overloaded on concept type.&nbsp; There are 
currently fourteen concepts in the Polygon library type system.&nbsp; A concept 
object in the Polygon library is just an empty struct similar to a tag that 
would be used for tag dispatching.&nbsp;&nbsp; These concepts are listed with 
the names they are given in the library code and abbreviations used for them in 
this document in the table below.</p>


</body><img border="0" src="images/concept_table.png" width="322" height="453"><p>
The arrows between diagram bubbles show concept refinement relationships.&nbsp; This is 
similar, but not identical to, inheritance relationships between normal classes.&nbsp; 
A refinement of a concept narrows down the definition of a more general concept.&nbsp; 
For example, the rectangle concept is a refinement of a polygon concept because 
it restricts the polygon to a four sided, axis-parallel, rectilinear figure.&nbsp; A refinement 
of a concept is always acceptable to an API that expects read only access to a 
given concept, but never acceptable to an API that expects to write to that 
concept.&nbsp; There are three types of geometry in the polygon library, the 
general case, the case restricted to angles that are multiples of 45 degrees, 
and the Manhattan/rectilinear case where angles are restricted to multiples of 
90 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The refinement diagram shows that 90 degree concepts are 
refinements of 45 degree concepts, which are themselves refinements of the 
general case.&nbsp; This allows the compiler to choose between the three 
implementations of algorithms to select the best algorithm for the conceptual 
data types passed to an overload of a function including heterogeneous 
combinations of 90, 45 and general case geometry.</p>
<p>Associated with each concept is a traits struct that generally must be 
specialized for a given data type to provide the concept mapping between the 
interfaces of the data type and the expected behaviors of an object of that type 
required by the library.&nbsp; The library also provides its own data types for 
each concept that conform to the default traits definition.&nbsp; When a data 
type has been mapped to a concept through traits it also needs to be registered 
as that conceptual type with the library.&nbsp; This is accomplished by 
specializing the geometry_concept meta-function.&nbsp; Once mapped and 
registered, a user data type can be used interchangeably with library data types 
in the generic free functions that are overloaded on concept.<p>Traits for 
mapping a data type to a concept a broken down into mutable and read only 
traits.&nbsp; Read only traits are specialized internally to work with any types 
that are refinements of a concept.&nbsp; The mutable traits are defined only for 
objects that exactly model the concept.&nbsp; Both read only traits and mutable 
traits need to be defined for a type to model a concept, but a type can be used 
without defining the mutable traits as long as no API that needs to modify the 
object is used with that type.&nbsp; For example, a triangle type could be 
registered as a polygon_concept and the read only traits but not the mutable 
traits defined for that triangle type.&nbsp; This would allow the triangle type 
to be passed into any API that expects a cost reference to an object that models 
polygon.&nbsp; <tr>
