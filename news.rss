<H4>Supported Compilers</H4>
<p>Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms will work as well. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.boost.org/regression/release/user/">regression test results</a>.</p>
<p><B>New for this release</B>: Support for building with the newest STLport-5.0 was added. The support includes building with MinGW Runtime 3.8 plus STLport-5.0 improved to support wide character operations. Apple GCC 4.0, HP Tru64 C++, and Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 are supported platforms. We have added an experimental autoconf-like <CODE>configure</CODE> script for Unix-like systems: run <CODE>configure --help</CODE> for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple GCC</a> 3.3, 4.0 on Mac OS X. 
<li><a href="http://www.borland.com/us/products/cbuilder/">Borland C++</a> 5.6.4 on Windows. 
<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU C++</a> 2.95.3 (with and without STLport), 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x on Windows, Linux and Solaris. 
<li><a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/cplus/">HP C++ for Tru64 UNIX 7.1</a>. 
<li><a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/index.htm">Intel C++</a> 8.1, 9.0 on Windows, Linux. 
<li><a href="http://www.metrowerks.com">Metrowerks CodeWarrior</a> 8.3, 9.4, 9.5 on Mac OS X and Windows. 
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/">Microsoft Visual C++</a> 6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0. Note: Boost does not support the non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define the macro <CODE>_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE</CODE>. </li></ul>
