readme.txt - VC++ 8.0 Project files

The project files in this directory should be sufficient to allow building and
debugging of the Boost.SqlCli dynamic library and the demo program. The projects
use the same path convention used by the Boost.Build (v2) system and assume
that the Boost.Signals library has been built. In order to build the projects
you can either use bjam or run the enclosed setup.bat command file, which
builds Boost.Signals with the required options.
