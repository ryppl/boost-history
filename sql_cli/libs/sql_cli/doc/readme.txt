readme.txt - The Boost.SqlCli library

The Boost.SqlCli library is an experiment on how the interface of a future Boost
database access library might look like. Currently it is in a very early stage
of development and just about everything is liable of changing beyond
recognition, starting from the library's name. Some very sketchy documentation -
a short rationale, a terse reference and a much larger to do / open issues
section - is available in libs/sql_cli/index.html .

The library is meant to be "dropped" into an existing Boost 1.34 / 1.35
installation.  Project files for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005, Borland C++ Builder
6 & 2006 and Bloodshed's Dev-C++ (MinGW) are available under the
libs/sql_cli/build directory.

The library home page mentioned in this and other files' headers is not
available and might never be; the library is being developed so as to be "Boost
ready", even if it is not yet clear whether it will ever reach a level of
quality and scope sufficient to consider official submission to Boost.
