[ Overview ]

    In this C++ library, we provide models of Model (statistics/model) in the 
    survival modeling framework.

[ Notation ] 

    See statistics/model/libs/model/doc/readme and the concept Model. Let mcp 
    denote an instance of model_covariate_parameter_<M, X, P>

[ Bug ]

    See libs/survival/example/posterior_analysis.cpp     

[ Compiler ]

gcc version i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1

[ History ]

July 2009 : Current version

[ models ]

These are models of [ SurvivalModel ] defined as:

Let U/u denote a type/object modeling UniformaRandomNumberGenerator (see 
Boost.Random)

M refines SurvivalModel if it models Model with the requirement that
    Expression                          Returns
    random::failure_time<T>(mcp,urng)   Object of type T

Modeled by : 
    model::exponential::model

[ meta ]

    - meta::failure_distribution maps M to a distribution in math/distributions
    - meta::failure_random maps M to a RandomDistribution in boost/random
    
    If these mappings are specified for M, random::failure_time is automatically
    defined for M.
