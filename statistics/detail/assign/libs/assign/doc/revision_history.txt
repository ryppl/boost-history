// Revision history:
//
// March 11, 2010 : Added assign/chain. See comments in detail/expr for rationale
// March 8, 2010 : Added a policy dispatcher, csv_policy, to allow a common
// policy tag for csv and non-csv functions.
// March 8, 2010 : Made array_interface derive from assign_detail::convert for 
// greater conformity with the rest of the library.
// March 7, 2010 : Added assign_reference_rebind whose op= and swap have rebind
// semantics.
// March 6, 2010 : Added support for range insertion
// March 4, 2010 : Created function template overloads to ref_list_of() etc. 
// that allow to specify a policy.
// March 1, 2010 : Factored interface into a policy. Csv functions now return an
// array-like structure; the collection is discarded. 
// Feb 27, 2010 : Support for comma separated arguments (See csv.hpp)
// Feb 25, 2010 : Added array-like functionality.
// Feb 21, 2010 : Made member variables mutable and added constness to member 
// functions where appropriate.
// Feb 9, 2010 : 
// 	- Added a template parameter for the reference wrapper
// 	- The temporary array in the conversion operator is now assigned by calling 
// 	begin() and end() rather than write_to_array() to ensure consistency of 
//  side effect. 
// Feb 5, 2010 : First version. rebind semantics.
