WHAT:

  This directory contains code which attempts to use the ideas in
  
    _An Apl Compiler_
    Timothy Budd
    Springer-Verlag 1988
    
  to implement multi-dimensional arrays in c++.

STATUS:

  *VERY* preliminary.  Just a few example codes in libs/*/examples
   directories.
  
FUTURE:

  Maybe none, depending on how much time and desire I have to
  work on it.
