To reproduce the test results that I offered on the Boost Developer's mailing
list, use this version of the library. Uncomment one of the XINT_TEST_* defines
near the top of internals.hpp and recompile the library (see README.txt for the
proper setup for that), then compile and run the test program (use the Jamroot
file in the test directory for that).

The testing code is in test/test_main.cpp.
