<h1><a class="anchor" id="r_too_big"><code>exceptions::too_big</code> sounds like <code>std::range_error</code> to me. </a></h1><p>With good reason -- it's essentially the same thing. But in Josuttis' "The C++
Standard Library", the wording on <code>std::range_error</code> is that it's "used to
report a range error in internal computations." That didn't quite sound like what I was trying to convey with that exception, which is that the library type that the user is trying to convert won't fit into the type that he's trying to convert it to. It does inherit from std::range_error though, so you can use either for most things, and get more specific if desired.</p>
<p>In addition, it seemed discordant to me to have a library that <em>almost</em> always throws exceptions from a particular namespace. It was almost no additional work to make it <em>always</em> throw from a specific namespace, and it fit my sense of rightness. </p>
