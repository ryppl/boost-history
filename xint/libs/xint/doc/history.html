<h1>Revision History </h1>  </div>
</div>
<div class="contents">
<p>This is the third incarnation of my large-integer library. The first was written as a research tool in 1995 and was never released. A second, improved version was used in some of my commercial Windows software. This third one shares only the spirit of the first two; it was designed and written from scratch using all the lessons I learned from writing the first two, as well as all the mathematical knowledge I could gather from various books and the Internet.</p>
<p>This revision history refers only to this incarnation.</p>
<p><b>2010-03-26</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>First version uploaded to the Boost File Vault for review.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2010-03-30</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Many improvements, primarily from feedback on the first Boost upload. Second version posted to the Boost File Vault.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2010-04-30</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Third version posted to the Boost File Vault for preliminary review.</li>
<li>Major redesign, separating xint::integer and xint::nothrow_integer, eliminating the exception-blocking functions, and adding an xint::fixed_integer template class.</li>
<li>Major overhaul of many of the functions, making them more efficient and fixing newly-discovered bugs.</li>
<li>All test functions now use Boost.Test, many new tests added.</li>
<li>All documentation moved to Doxygen format.</li>
<li>Moved xint namespace into boost namespace.</li>
<li>"Fixed" several small memory leaks. Most of them weren't real leaks, but Boost.Test couldn't tell that.</li>
<li>Many less-major changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2010-06-01</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fourth version posted to the Boost File Vault for preliminary review.</li>
<li>Another major redesign. All three types are now templates; and it can now be compiled or used as a header-only library.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2010-06-12</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fifth version posted to the Boost File Vault for preliminary review.</li>
<li>Final major redesign (I hope). All types are consolidated into a single <code>integer_t</code> template type.</li>
<li>The library is now solely header-only, dictated by the templated nature of the types.</li>
<li>Added Boost.Parameter options to the <code>integer_t</code> type, so you're no longer forced to list the options in order, and list all earlier options before the one that you want to change.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2010-06-18</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Sixth version posted to the Boost File Vault for preliminary review.</li>
<li>Refined the use of Boost.Parameter. Now only <code>fixedlength</code> takes a parameter; the other options are non-parameter types, which simplifies both their use and their implementation.</li>
<li>Minor redesign, taking advantage of <em>proper</em> policy-based design. nan() and operator~() are now only available on <code>nothrow</code> and <code>fixedlength</code> types, respectively, and is_nan() gets different definitions in the standard and <code>nothrow</code> types.</li>
<li>Added unsigned support, by request, with a variety of options for what to do when a calculation results in a negative number.</li>
<li>Added the <code>difference</code> function.</li>
<li>Added support for wide-character strings, by request.</li>
<li>Added the safe-bool idiom, by request. </li>
</ul>
