<h1><a class="anchor" id="threadsafe">The <code>Threadsafe</code> Template Parameter </a></h1><p>The <code>Threadsafe</code> parameter, on the integer_t, nothrow_integer_t, and fixed_integer templates, controls the copy-on-write behavior of the program. When set to <code>false</code>, identical integer objects are allowed to share storage, which is more efficient for both CPU power and memory, but which is generally not safe for multithreaded programs.</p>
<p>That's a simplification though. The only problem multithreaded programs have with copy-on-write is that one thread might change an object while another is reading from it. Since the copy-on-write behavior is entirely internal to the class, no other code can tell when it's safe to make changes to an object. This is only a problem when more than one thread can access a specific object. So long as an integer object is only accessed from the thread that it's created in, there's no danger.</p>
<p>If you want the speed of copy-on-write (which can be noticeable if you're dealing with very large numbers), but need to use integer objects from multiple threads when one or more might alter them, you can use the <code>force_thread_safety</code> parameter on the object's copy constructor to make a duplicate of an object with its own unique storage, even if the <code>Threadsafe</code> template parameter is <code>false</code>. You'll only need to do that when crossing thread boundaries. </p>
