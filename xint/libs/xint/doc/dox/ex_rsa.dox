/*! \page ex_rsa RSA Encryption

Here is an RSA encryption example. It uses unsigned, fixed-length integers with
the "secure" option.

Please note that this example, while fairly complete, is minimal. It does not
include signing or verification of signatures, and does nothing to prevent a
known attack method (the "low encryption exponent" attack).

You can find this example as the file \c rsa.cpp in the \c example directory.

\include rsa.cpp
