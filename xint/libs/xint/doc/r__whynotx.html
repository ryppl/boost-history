<h1><a class="anchor" id="r_whynotx">I've got a great idea! Why don't you do <em>X</em>? </a></h1><p>This kind of suggestion, where <em>X</em> is something that would require days or weeks of work to finish and test properly, has come up several times already. Often enough that I've gotten tired of finding ways to diplomatically say no. So I'll lay out the reasons here, once and for all:</p>
<ul>
<li>The alternative to "release early, release often" is to release late and infrequently, or not at all.</li>
<li>I need feedback from people who are actually <em>using</em> the library in order to improve it. Repeatedly delaying it to add another neat feature makes this impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>By all means, make suggestions. But don't be offended if I respond by referring you to this page. It only means that I feel that your suggestion isn't appropriate for this version, because it would delay it further, not that it isn't appropriate at all. </p>
