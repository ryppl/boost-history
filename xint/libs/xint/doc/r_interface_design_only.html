<p>The XInt library was designed before I knew about them. I adapted it to them later.</p>
<p>There are only a few notable places where XInt differs from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not provide separate mathematical primitive functions for <code>long long</code>, as suggested in n1744. This is partly because <code>long long</code> is not yet in the C++ standard, but mostly because I don't see a need for it. The conversion constructors are efficient enough for smaller values that there wouldn't be any noticeable benefit from it.</li>
<li>It does not, at present, implement a multiplication scheme with better performance than the "basecase" mentioned in section 3.4 of n1692, primarily because I haven't had the time to research all of them yet. I suspect that most people using the library will usually be using numbers below the threshold where the more exotic algorithms are faster, but I plan to add at least one of them in the future, maybe several. </li>
</ul>
