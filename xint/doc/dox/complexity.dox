/*! \page complexity A Note on Algorithmic Complexity

This documentation includes a time-complexity estimate, in big-O notation, for
each algorithm. The time complexity is well-known for some algorithms, but for
others, I had to make an educated guess. If you discover an error in the listed
complexity, please report it.
