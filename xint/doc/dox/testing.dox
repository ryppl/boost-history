/*! \page testing The Self-Testing Program

The library has a self-testing program that you can build and run to confirm
that it is working properly. You can find the source code for it in the \c test
subdirectory under the main \c %xint directory. All of the major functions are
thoroughly exercised, and many of the minor ones as well.

The source code for the testing program also demonstrates how to use many of the
library's functions.
