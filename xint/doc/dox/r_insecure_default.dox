/*! \page r_insecure_default But why default to an insecure random number generator? Why not default to the secure one?

Because the secure one isn't available on all systems. If I relied on
\c random_device as a default, the library wouldn't compile under those systems.
If I used \c xint::strong_random_generator, it would compile, but would always
fail on them.
