/*! \page securemode Secure Mode

For high-security applications, this library has a Secure Mode compile-time
option. In Secure Mode, all memory is zeroed before being released.

To enable it, define the preprocessor symbol \c XINT_SECURE when compiling the
library. You don't need to define it when using the library, only when compiling
it.

To see whether your copy was compiled with secure-mode enabled, use the
xint::opt_secure_mode function.
