<h1><a class="anchor" id="r_negzero">Since you've got Not-a-Number, what about negative zero, and positive and negative infinity, like IEEE floating-point numbers? </a></h1><p>Because they're irrelevant to an arbitrary-sized integer library.</p>
<p>The mathematical concept of zero has no sign. It's neither positive nor negative (or if you prefer, it's both). The concept of a signed zero is used in floating-point numbers to represent a value that's so small that it can't be distinguished from zero, but which may not be an actual zero. Such a non-zero number does have a sign. But mathematically, a negative zero is simply zero.</p>
<p>The concept of infinity (in either direction) comes up very rarely in an integer library. Since infinity is a concept, not a countable value, it's simply represented by the Not-a-Number value in the few places that it might be needed. </p>
