* Unit test
  NEARLY DONE * test operations
  OK * test standard_algebra
  OK * test fusion_algebra
  * test vector_space_algebra, maybe with some proto lib
  * test copying
  * test gsl
  * test explicit stepper with ranges
OK * change standard_operations::rel_error in order to word with units and test it
OK * include implicit euler
  OK * call via std::pair< deriv , jacobi >
  OK * resizing
* include rosenbrock4 in trunk
OK * operations that fit units
OK * operations that fit result_of
* include test/thrust in jam system, use system from 
OK * change stepper to stepper_units
OK * change error_stepper to error_stepper_units
DIFFICULT * finishing change of controlled_stepper to units
  * check if rosenbrock controller and controlled_stepper can both be used with the explicit steppers
  OK * move error_checker into controlled_stepper
  * rename controlled_stepper to a more specific name
DIFICULT * change dense_output to units
  * roll out dense_output_explicit_euler::calc_state() to explicit_euler::dense_output()
  * roll out dense_output_dopri5::calc_state() to explicit_error_dopri5::dense_output()
  * create dense_output_explicit
  * create dense_output_explicit_controlled
  * create dense_output_explicit_controlled_fsal
  * maybe remove dense_output_explicit
* split check_concepts into check_stepper_concept, check_error_stepper_concept, check_controlled_stepper_concept
* split resizing and copy/destruct/construct in different files
OK * change resizing concept, in order to word within the implicit steppers
OK * in all tests and regression test do not include odeint.hpp, only include the headers which are really needed
* start new doc or cleanup the old project

* Integrate functions
* skript for setting the include defines according to the position in file system an writing a general copyright comment at the beginning
