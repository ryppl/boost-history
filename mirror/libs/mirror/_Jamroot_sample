# This is a sample Jamroot file for the mirror library. You
# can use this file in case You don't have a more suitable Jamroot.
# This sample can be renamed to Jamroot and placed to the immediate 
# parent directory of the mirror root directory. 
# ie. You can have a */devel/ directory with this Jamroot, optionally
# also with a boost_build.jam file and with the mirror/ folder containing
# the sources of mirror.

    # You can use one of the following if $(BOOST_ROOT) is not working
    #  <include>"C:/boost/boost_1_35_0"

    #  You can optionally set up a new build directory instead of
    #  'bin' in the folder where a Jamfile resided. 
    #  Leaving this uncommented will make bjam build into a directory
    #  called _build in the folder where this Jamroot file is.
