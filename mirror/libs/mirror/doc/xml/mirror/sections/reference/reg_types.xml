		There are several macros that do the type registering. The types or classes declared on the global scope can be registered with the <feat_ref>REG_TYPE_GLOBAL_SCOPE</feat_ref> macro.
		Types declared in a named namespace are registered with the <feat_ref>REG_TYPE</feat_ref> and <feat_ref>REG_TYPEDEFD</feat_ref> macros.
		Types declared inside of a class can be registered with the <feat_ref>REG_TYPE_EMBEDDED</feat_ref> macro.
