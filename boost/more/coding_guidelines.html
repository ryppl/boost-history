      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This document is not intended to act as requirements for
 boost, but as a set of ``guideposts to uniformity'', for those cases
 where authors have no preference or are willing to change.  Nobody
 likes following arbitrary rules, and when compliance is voluntary,
 it's likely that nobody will. Therefore, wherever possible, choices
 are made with careful attention to engineering merit and the
 underlying rationale is presented.

 <p>All the same, the authors of these guidelines intend that they be
 followed. We have learned long ago that bending the rules here or there at a
 whim (even with justification) tends toward code rot. Eventually your program
 grows such that all of your acceptable violations become unacceptable.  This
 happens insidiously, so they never get addressed. So, if you choose to follow
 these guidelines, we suggest that you resist the temptation to allow yourself
 exceptions.

 <p>Because C++ is a markedly different language from C, good C++ code looks
 markedly different from good C code. Differences from good C style follow from
 these differences:

  <ul>
    <li>Names -- particularly, qualified names, and expressions and declarations
    in C++ are often much longer than in C.

    <li>Scoping in C++ is more complex than in C. 

    <li>Types in C++ are semantically far more important than in C. 

    <li>Local variable definitions in C++ are mixed in with other statements. 

    <li>C++ includes constructs that don't exist in C. 

    <li>C++ overloads syntactic elements even more heavily than C. 

    <li>Semantics of some C++ constructs differ from C. 
  </ul>

  <p>Rules below are based on some broad principles:

  <ul>
    <li>Direct expression of concepts in code is much better than annotation in
    comments.

    <li>Comprehensibility for maintainers, and robustness against changes during
    maintenance, are at least as important as convenience for coders.

    <li>Formatting should be deterministic and straightforward. Time spent
    thinking about formatting code is time better spent writing it.

    <li>Sources of subtle bugs should be given a wide berth.

    <li>Meaningless-busywork rules get ignored.
  </ul>

      <h2><a name="files_preprocessor">1. Files and the preprocessor</a></h2>

      <p>
      1.1.   <b>Change logs</b>, if used, appear at the bottom of files. A
      source file's primary role is as documentation of the <i>current</i> state
      of the project.

      <p>
      1.2.   <b>Use unique <tt>#include</tt> guards in header files.</b> With
      only very rare exceptions, every C++ header file neeeds #include guards to
      prevent its definitions from being seen multiple times. You may use a <a
      href="http://www.guid.org">GUID</a>, or you can incorporate your initials
      and the date as shown in this <a href="#include_guards" title=
      "RECTANGLE_DWA050499_H_">example</a>. Don't rely on these
      <tt>#include</tt> guards being meaningful: the date and initials are
      <i>solely</i> for sufficient uniqueness, and people use different
      conventions for expressing dates.

      <p>
      1.3.   <b>Avoid preprocessor macros</b> (i.e. <tt>#define</tt>),
      especially in header files - use inline functions or function templates
      (for function-style macros) and enums or constants (for other macros)
      instead. Preprocessor symbols march across namespace and scope boundaries
      and can change the meaning of code in unexpected ways. Of course,
      <tt>#include</tt> guards are a necessary exception to this guideline.

      <p>
      1.4.   <b>Source file names are <tt>lower_case</tt>,</b> because of the
      vagaries of filename case-sensitivity on various platforms.

      <p>
      1.5.   <b>Source files should <tt>#include</tt> the corresponding header
      file first.</b> To be sure that each header file can be safely
      <tt>#include</tt>d regardless of which other files have been
      <tt>#include</tt>d first, we use this technique to help ensure that each
      header is <tt>#include</tt>d first <i>somewhere.</i> Of course, this
      technique's effectiveness is mitigated by the extent to which (generic)
      code appears in header files.

      <p>
      1.6.   <b>All <tt>#include</tt> directives appear at the top</b> of source
      files, and just after the <tt>#include</tt> guards in header files.

      <p>
      1.7.   <b>Avoid header file dependencies.</b> If the header file only
      needs to use pointers or references to a given class, a <a
      href="#forward_declaration" title="class point;">forward declaration</a>
      can be used in lieu of including the header which contains the
      class' definition.  This practice can reduce compile times and
      eliminate confusing situations that arise when two definitions appear to
      be interdependent.  <i>Don't</i> change your designs just for the
      sake of this guideline, but <i>do</i> apply it whenever possible. Of
      course, this technique's effectiveness is mitigated by the extent to which
      (generic) code appears in header files.

      <b>Caveat</b>: it is illegal (with good reason) for users to
      forward-declare names in namespace std::. We haven't yet seen a
      compiler which will detect violations of this rule, so be careful not to!

      <p>
      1.8.   <b>Use relative #include paths.</b> Directory paths should mimic
      the project's namespace structure. Just as we use namespaces to
      prevent C++ name collisions, we use directory paths to prevent #include
      file name collisions.

      <h2><a name="naming">2. Naming</a></h2>

      <p>2.1. <b>Names</b>, unless otherwise specified below, should be written
      <b><tt>all_lower_case</tt></b> with underscores separating sub-word
      components. Acronyms should be treated as complete words:
      <tt>vhdl_ams_parser</tt>. [Contrary to some popular standards, this rule
      applies to type names in nearly all contexts, making our naming consistent
      with both the standard library and boost conventions].

      <p>
      2.2. Names of template <i>formal</i> type parameters e.g., are written
      <tt>InMixedCase</tt>, with capitalized sub-words, e.g.
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;class <b>InputIterator</b>&gt;
struct adaptor { typedef <b>InputIterator</b> base_iterator; };
</pre>
</blockquote>
      Treat acronyms as
      ordinary words, with only the first letter capitalized
      (e.g. <tt>XmlObject</tt>).

      <p>
      2.3.   <b>Concept names</b> in documentation (e.g. Assignable,
      ForwardIterator) follow the same rules as template formal type parameters
      (i.e. should also be written InMixedCase).

      <p>
      2.4.   <b>Choose complete
      words or phrases</b> for names other than loop counters and iterators. A
      good name is better than a comment explaining what the entity does.

      <p>
      2.5.   <b>Avoid abbreviations</b> and compound words:
      ``Iterator'' is better than ``Iter''. A short word is
      better than a shortened word.

      <p>
      2.6.   <b>Choose names to indicate purpose</b>
      (e.g. <tt>known_devices</tt>) rather than implementation
      (e.g. <tt>device_list</tt>); the implementation is already visible in the
      declaration.

      <p>
      2.7.   <b>Boolean variables
      and functions should read as English predicate phrases</b>, so
      that conditional statements using them read as grammatical English
      sentences.

      <p>
      2.8.   <b>Functions with side effects</b> should be English active-verb
      phrases.

      <p>
      2.9.   <b>Avoid trademarks</b> in names (including ``Altra'').

      <p>
      2.10. <b>Data members</b> should have a ``<tt>m_</tt>''
      prefix, to distinguish them from an otherwise-identical member function
      name and to clarify their provenance in code which uses them. Non-member
      names must not have an ``<tt>m_</tt>'' prefix.

      <p>
      2.11.        <b>Short names should respect common conventions</b>:
      ``<tt>i</tt>'', ``<tt>j</tt>'', and
      ``<tt>k</tt>'', if used, should be loop control variables;
      ``<tt>p</tt>'' and ``<tt>q</tt>'' should generally be
      pointers or iterators.

      <p>
      2.12. <b>Functions describing the state of an object</b> should be
      English noun phrases (e.g. <tt>size()</tt>, <i>not</i>
      <tt>get_size()</tt>).

      <p>
      2.13. <b>Preprocessor macros</b> should be avoided. Where neccessary,
      macros are <b>ALL_CAPS</b>. Avoid defining macros in header files with
      extreme prejudice. Any macro names which <i>must</i> appear in headers
      should be very long, or #undef'd after use.

      <p>
      2.14. <b>Names containing double underscores</b> (``<tt>__</tt>'') or
       beginning with single underscores (``<tt>_</tt>'') are entirely
       forbidden. These are reserved to the C++ implementation in various
       contexts.

      <h3><a name="AEN75">Discussion:</a></h3>

      <p>Macro names walk freely across scope boundaries, and their use even in
      system headers tends to anarchy.

      <p>Trademarked names cause disruptions when ownership of code or
      trademarks changes hands. For example, we may make a deal to sell or
      license our code to a partner. If we use a trademark name we might easily
      create work for ourselves changing names later. We might consider using
      ``<tt>altra</tt>'' as a namespace name, but should do so only
      after careful consideration and with group consensus.

      <p>The naming pattern "is_foo" for predicate names comes from decades of C
      tradition. In general, type prefixes and suffixes
      (``<tt>psz</tt>'', ``<tt>_p</tt>'',
      <tt>``_ptr''</tt>) are needed in languages and environments
      where object type has been lost, or to avoid colliding with type
      names. They make code harder to read as English and obscure the
      abstraction being manipulated with implementation details. They also
      create an undesirable link between interface and implementation,
      discouraging the drop-in replacement of one type for another (a very
      common and powerful strategy for correctly evolving and modernizing old
      code). Solve the problems that type labels solve by writing small
      functions and declaring local variables close to their point of first use.

      <p>Some names beginning with underscores are not reserved to the
      implementation, but these names don't add enough expressiveness to the
      language to be worth complicating the rules. Furthermore, in practice it
      is not uncommon for system headers to define these names as macros,
      effectively reserving them in <i>all</i> contexts. In order to maximize
      portability, such names are banned.

      <h2><a name="expression_spacing">3. Expression spacing and bracketing</a></h2>

      <p>
      3.1.   <b>Binary
      operators</b> are separated from their operands by whitespace.

      <p>
      <a name="unary_post_operators"></a>3.2.   <b>Unary
      post-operators</b> such as the function-call, array-index, and
      post-increment operators should not be preceded by space.

      <p>
      3.3.   <b>Unary
      pre-operators</b> such as dereference and logical negation should not be
      followed by space.

      <p>
      3.4.   <b>The dereference
      operator </b>``<b>-&gt;</b>'' should neither be preceded by nor followed by
      whitespace.

      <p>
      3.5.   <b>Fully parenthesize uses of bitwise operators</b>. Most people
      remember the precedence relationship between ``&amp;'' and ``|'', but lose
      track when used in any other combinations. To reduce time looking in the
      standard and tracking down bugs, fully-parenthesize uses of ``&lt;&lt;'',
      ``&gt;&gt;'', and ``^'' when mixed with other operators. ``&amp;'' and
      ``|'' may be mixed freely, but should be parenthesized when combined with
      any other operators.

      <p>
      3.6.   <b><tt>return</tt> is not a function</b>; do not put parentheses around
      the value being returned. This also goes for <tt>throw</tt>.

      <p>
      3.7.   <b>Break expressions
      before an operator</b> if possible, when they get too long. This helps
      mark the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of the line as a continuation.

      <h3><a name="AEN114">Examples:</a></h3>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
        <tr>
          <td>
<pre>
// <b>Right:</b>

p[i++] = q[j++];
if (this-&gt;headers()-&gt;is_empty())
unsigned y = 0xf &amp; (x + 1);
 
std::complex&lt;double&gt; total_offset = initial_offset + 3 * step_size
   + extra_steps * extra_step_size + 1.0;
 
if (!x)
    return y;

throw std::range_error(&quot;out of range&quot;);

   extra_steps*extra_step_size+1.0;
 
if (! x)
    return(y);

throw(std::range_error(&quot;out of range&quot;));
</pre></table>

      <h3><a name="AEN118">Discussion:</a></h3>

      <p>Beginning a continuation line with an operator helps to emphasize that
      it is not a standalone expression.

      <p>The following arguments, cumulatively, lead to <a href=
      "#unary_post_operators" title=
      "No spaces before unary post-operators">3.2</a> above.

<ul>
      <li>        
      Parentheses are even more heavily overloaded in C++ than in C,
      and the placement of a space before some uses (e.g. in control structures
      and to group expressions) helps to distinguish those uses.

      <li>        
      Spaces around binary operators help visually to identify terms
      in an expression, and to distinguish overloaded unary from binary
      operators. Lack of spaces next to unary operators helps emphasize this
      role.

      <li>         In
      C++, unlike in C, "()" is explicitly an operator, and even GNU doesn't
      suggest a space before other unary operators (although it seems sometimes
      to suggest a space after some unary operators, e.g. "!", but not others,
      e.g. "++"... we do not follow that rule).

      <li>         In
      C++, unlike in C, the argument list of a function is part of its name,
      just as the tilde is part of the destructor's name.

      <li>        
      Spaces inserted in expressions involving two or more
      applications of the function-call <tt>operator()()</tt>, as in

      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="90%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
        <tr>
          <td>
<pre>
    return this-&gt;guarantor ()-&gt;lookup (name)-&gt;as_string ().c_str ();
           +-------------+ +--------+ +---------------+ +------+ +-+ 
</pre>
      </table>

      lead to odd groupings.

      <li>        
      Every C++ textbook -- I have 10 here, not counting C books --
      places a unary operator, including function-call, directly adjacent to
      its argument. Only GNU departs from this industry-wide standard, for
      reasons that appear to refer rather to LISP than C conventions.

</ul>
      <h2><a name="def_decl_spacing">4. Spacing of definitions and declarations</a></h2>

      <p>
      4.1.   <b>Definitions at primary namespace or global scope</b> begin at
      the left margin. Opening the primary named namespace in a file does not
      induce an extra level of indentation. Secondary nested namespaces
      (e.g. ``...<tt>::detail</tt>'') may cause additional indentation
      of 2 spaces.

      <p>
      4.2.   <b>Separate lines</b> at identical indentation are devoted
      to:<ul>
      <li>any `` <tt>template&lt;</tt>...<tt>&gt;</tt>'' clause
      <li>the name of a class or function being defined
      <li>the opening and closing braces of a function, statement, or class body
      </ul>

      <p>
      4.3.   The <b>return type</b> and storage class of a function go on the
      same line as the name.

      <p>
      4.4.   A blank line is required <b>between consecutive multi-line
      definitions</b>.

      <p>
      4.5.   <b>Definitions in class bodies</b> are indented four spaces from
      the enclosing brackets.  Second and subsequent lines of member definitions
      in class bodies are further indented.

      <p>
      4.6.   <b>Arguments to function definitions</b> are on separate lines and
      indented two to four spaces (not out to the open-parenthesis). Other
      breaks may be indented to line up with other expression elements.

      <p>
      4.7. <b>Multiline declarations should be separated from other code by blank
      lines</b>.

      <p>
      4.8.   <b>Access specifiers</b> (<tt>public</tt>, <tt>private</tt>, and

      <p>
      4.9.   <b>Omit spaces in <a href="#template_instantiation">template
      instantiations</a></b>. Spaces are allowed between arguments to <a
      href="#template_declaration">template declarations</a>. Unnecessary spaces
      in type names weaken their recognizability as a syntactic
      unit. Instantiations with names that are too unwieldy in this form should

      <p>
      5.1.   <b>Use a separate line
      for opening and closing braces.</b> If you find that your functions are
      taking up too much space, break them into smaller pieces. Empty blocks
      may begin and end with brackets on the same line.

      <p>
      5.2.   <b>Braces should have
      the same indentation as the previous line.</b> The GNU indentation style,
      where braces are indented more than the previous line, but less than the
      code they contain, introduces visual clutter that harms
      readability.

      <p>
      5.3.   <b>Statements within a
      block are indented four spaces</b>.

      <p>
      5.4.   <b>Use spaces, not
      tabs, for indentation.</b> If everyone always used tabs, it would
      probably be OK, but since they don't we end up with files full of
      mixed spaces and tabs. Variable tab width causes alignment problems, so

      allowing breakpoints to be set on the dependent clause.

      5.8.   <b>Second and subsequent lines of a statement are indented</b> at
      least two spaces.  The function-call operator "<tt>()</tt>" does not
      introduce a subexpression, so should not be grouped and indented like
      parentheses that do. Terms within an expression may be indented according
      to expression structure.

      6.2.   <a href= "#place_ptr" title="e.g. char* p;"><b>Place <tt>*</tt> and
      <tt>&amp;</tt> with the type name</b></a>, not the object name. This
      guideline and the previous one are corrolaries: we eschew the compact but
      unclear style inherited from `C' which makes it neccessary to
      bind type qualifiers to the name they are qualifying.

      <p>
      6.3.   <a href= "#initialize_locals" title="e.g., int x=1;"><b>Initialize
      local variables</b></a> whenever a meaningful value is available. This
      prevents uninitialized variables from being used, and is enables the
      following guideline to be fully realized.

      <p>
      6.4.   <b>Define local
      variables as late as possible</b>, when they can be meaningfully
      initialized and used immediately. Doing otherwise forces the reader more
      to consider variables not yet relevant to code at hand, and often costs
      efficiency since we pay for both construction and initialization.

      <p>
      6.5.   <a href= "#dont_reuse_variables"><b>Do not re-use a
      variable</b></a> for different purposes. Re-using local variables does not
      save on resources; the compiler knows when a variable is no longer
      used. Re-using a variable can confuse readers, and sometimes also inhibits
      optimization by the compiler. Reusing variable <i>names</i>, e.g. loop
      control variables which are limited to different scopes, is OK.

      <p>
      6.6.   <b>Use <tt>const</tt> wherever possible.</b> Code is clearer when
      values do not change. Declaring a variable <tt>const</tt> allows a
      programmer to brace herself against the compiler to check that her
      intention is fulfilled. This guideline works synergistically with the
      previous one, and is particularly powerful when used on parameters <a
      href="#const_in_function_definition" title= "example of const function
      parameters">in function definitions</a>.  Declaring a value-parameter
      <tt>const</tt> has no effect in a function declaration and is meaningless
      to the caller, so leave const off here -- use it at the point of
      function definition instead.

      <p>6.7. <b><a href= "#const_placement">Place <tt>const</tt> after the base
      type it modifies</a>.</b> This simple rule makes it easier to
      write type declarations correctly and will make your declarations

      7.3.   <b>All function interfaces must be commented</b> (except for copy
      constructors, operator overloads such as copy-assignment and dereference,
      and destructors). The comment describes precisely what the function

      <p>
      7.4.   <b>Comment function interfaces in just one place.</b> It can be
      difficult enough just to keep comments synchronized with code. Just as not
      duplicating code reduces the risk that some code will grow stale,
      commenting a function in one place only reduces the risk of comments not
      being maintained together. Whether a function interface comment must
      appear at the point of declaration or of definition is covered below.

      <p>
      7.5.   <b>Comment the <i>declarations</i> of all public and protected member
      functions</b> other than copy constructors, copy-assignment operators,
      and destructors when they have well-understood idiomatic meanings.

      <p>
      7.6.   <b>Comment <i>every</i> virtual function only at its least-derived
      point of declaration.</b> This applies even if the function is
      private. The comment describes how and when it is called, why you would
      want to override it, and, for non-pure functions, the effects of the
      default implementation.

      <p>
      7.7.   <b>Declarations of free functions that are part of a public
      interface</b> should be commented.

      <p>
      7.8.   <b>All other functions</b> (private non-virtual functions,
      functions in unnamed namespaces) should be commented where they are
      implemented. In general, try to keep the description of implementation
      details out of header files.

      <a name="strive_for_brevity">7.9.   <b>Strive for brevity</b></a>
      <b>inside of class declarations.</b> Commenting member functions well is
      difficult. Try to avoid obscuring the structure and interface of the class
      with long comments. Sometimes this means you spend more time editing the
      comment than writing the function<a href= "#accuracy_is_important" title=
      "Accuracy is more important than brevity.">*</a>.

      <p>
      7.10.        <b>Comments within code</b> should answer the question
      ``why'', not ``what''. Good comments do not replicate
      information already clearly visible in code, but call attention to
      subtleties and fragilities. Obvious code is harmed by commenting, but be
      aware that what is obvious to the writer is often obscure to the reader. A
      large comment block organized as paragraphs is more useful than cryptic
      one-line comments distributed through code, and less distracting.

      <p>
      7.11.        <b>Use correct English sentences</b>, with proper spelling,
      capitalization and punctuation.

      <p>
      7.12.        <b>Use standard C++ terminology</b> when writing about C++

      template</i> instead of <i>template class</i> and <i>data
      member</i> instead of <i>attribute</i> or <i>instance
      variable</i>.

      <p>
      7.13. <b>Write names as they appear in code.</b> Function,
      variable and type names are lower-case even at the beginning of
      a sentence. Names of Concepts are capitalized, wherever they
      appear. Function names have ``<tt>()</tt>'' appended.

      <p>
      7.14.        <b>Class
      invariants</b> that are visible through public or protected interfaces
      should be documented before the class declaration. Invariants specific to
      the implementation should be documented before most of the class
      implementation.

      <p>
      7.15.        <b>Comment out code using ``</b>
      <tt>#if&nbsp;0</tt>...<tt>#endif</tt>'', or ``<tt>//</tt>'', not
      ``<tt>/*</tt>...<tt>*/</tt>'' comment notation.

      <h3><a name="AEN222">Discussion:</a></h3>

      <p>The problem with <tt>/*</tt>...<tt>*/</tt> is that it doesn't
      nest properly.  People sometimes try to comment out a long
      section by enclosing it in <tt>/*</tt>...<tt>*/</tt>, but if it
      already contains <tt>/*</tt>...<tt>*/</tt> somewhere, then the
      first <tt>*/</tt> ends the comment. It is often suggested that
      <tt>/*</tt>...<tt>*/</tt> should be allowed for <i>text</i>
      comments, but you can embed code examples in text, which causes
      the same nesting problem.



      <p>A short ``<tt>()</tt>'' makes the difference between having
      to say ``calls the <tt>insert</tt> function'' and ``calls
      <tt>insert()</tt>''.

      <p>Short comments on class member functions help to document a
      class' interface without obscuring its overall structure.

      <p>A virtual function and its overriders share a common interface, and
      are meant to be able to be used in a common way through a pointer or
      reference to the base class in which it is first declared. Thus,
      commentary about how to use this interface goes with the first
      (least-derived) declaration.

      <p>Reading cluttered class bodies is hard enough without big function and
      nested-class definitions mixed in. Substantial blocks of "other" material
      can and should be forward-declared in the class body, and defined
      separately whenever possible. If your class' public and protected
      interface is still hard to take in at a glance, consider refactoring it
      into smaller parts.

      <p>Writing `virtual' on the
      declaration of a virtual function override is neither neccessary nor
      sufficient to document where it comes from and which code it interacts
      with. Leaving the keyword off in derived classes reduces clutter and
      thwarts the temptation to treat it as sufficient documentation.

      <p>Inlines are the third most-misused C++ feature (after inheritance and
      overloading), used far more often than any practical criterion could
      justify, just because it is more covenient to write them in place.
      Anything that encourages their use beyond strict engineering merit is
      detrimental.

      <p>  Writing `<tt>inline</tt>' on the declaration of a member function
      documents an implementation detail in an inappropriate place. A class
      declaration should clearly document interface. Implementation details
      should be documented where they are implemented.


      <p>Function objects are often just wrappers over a simple function or
      function template. Separating interface from implementation in that case
      often makes things harder to read.

      <h2><a name="inheritance">9. Inheritance</a> and run-time polymorphism</h2>

      <p>
      9.1. <b>Avoid inheritance</b> in your public interface, unless you really
      mean it. Public inheritance establishes an <i>is-a</i> relationship, where
      the derived class can always be converted to, or used in place of, the
      base class. Use containment or delegation rather than private inheritance
      to establish an <i>is-implemented-in-terms-of</i> relationship.

      <p>
      9.2. <b>Base classes should be abstract.</b> You should avoid creating
      concrete non-leaf classes for two reasons: first, the implicit is-a
      relationship is usually not desired, and tends to miscommunicate your
      intent. Second, instances of the derived class can be converted to actual
      instances of concrete base classes, which can result in undesirable
      ``slicing''. A concrete base can be factored into an abstract
      interface and a concrete non-base class, which helps to document
      commonality. If you must write concrete base classes, the slicing can be
      prevented by making them noncopyable.

      <p>
      9.3.   <b>Override a virtual function at most once</b> in any path up the
      inheritance hierarchy. No derived class should implement a virtual
      function that is also implemented in one of its ancestors, except in the
      class where that function is first declared. This helps to clarify designs
      by keeping the model simple: the function to be called is either the
      default implementation, or it is the (single) overrider.

      <p>
      9.4.   <b>Implementors of derived classes are <i>clients</i> of the base
      class.</b> Anticipate the needs of derived class implementors (even if
      they're you). Provide a non-empty, non-pure virtual function only
      when you expect a subclass to completely replace the function's
      implementation. Do not force derived class implementors to understand
      whether to do their work before, after, around, or instead of the base
      class implementation. Instead, provide hook functions with empty
      implementations for subclasses to add behavior.

      <p>
      9.5. <b>Avoid calling a base class' version of a virtual function
      explicitly</b>, especially from the derived class' override. The need to
      do this is usually an indication of careless design in the base class.
      Instead, refactor the base class implementation as detailed above.

      <p>
      9.6. <b>Non-pure virtual functions should be private.</b> If necessary,
      provide a separate public or protected interface which calls the virtual
      function. This allows the base class implementation to add extra pre- or
      post-processing steps without worrying about the derived class
      implementations. Pure virtual functions do double-duty as a way of
      requiring a particular interface in derived classes, so they may be
      public.

      <p>
      9.7. <b>Make virtual functions pure virtual in a base class</b> unless a
      default behavior is desired.

      <h3><a name="AEN284">Discussion:</a></h3>

      <p>Every class provides two interfaces to the outside world. The public
      interface is obvious, but the interface for derived classes includes all
      protected members (accessiblity) and all virtual functions, regardless of
      access privilege (replacement of functionality). Making virtual functions
      private wherever possible helps to keep down the already substantial
      amount of thinking needed to verify correctness, by ensuring the context
      of a call of a particular base implementation. One never needs to ask
      ``what assumptions are being made about the program's state
      which might be violated in a derived class?'', because the base class
      implementation is only called from one place.

      <p>Experience has shown that use of protected data leads to severe
      maintenance problems, as implementations at different levels of a class
      hierarchy make different assumptions about how protected data may be used.

      <p>Inheritance is the single most overused language feature. It is
      over-promoted in textbooks by equating its use with "object-oriented"
      programming, and that with "good" programming. Object-oriented programming
      is one style among many supported by C++.

      <p>Occasional use of public inheritance as a <i>private implementation
      detail</i> of a class is OK when it can be used to avoid writing lots of
      forwarding functions. In this case, however, the complete public interface
      of the derived class must be described somewhere in documentation, even
      though part of it is supplied by a base class.

      <h2><a name="component_docs">10. Component documentation</a></h2>

      <p>
      10.1.  <b>Precede each component with a comment block describing its
      interface</b>. A component is a class or small set of closely related
      classes and functions, usually in a single header file.

      <p>
      10.2.  <b>Component interface comments</b> should say what the component
      is for and how it should be used. If the component supports specialized
      idioms (e.g. the way std::auto_ptr suppports transfer of ownership), this
      is the place to give examples. If the component being documented is
      unremarkable, brevity is fine.

      <p>
      10.3. <b>Document the interface for derived class implementors
      separately</b> from the public interface. Use a separate section in the
      comment block, if extra commentary is needed . The latter defines what is
      required of derived classes that implement the interface, and what the
      base class definition does (if anything).

      <p>
      10.4. <b>Template documentation must list the specific operations
      applied</b> by the template to actual-argument types, as do the Concepts
      (e.g.  <i>forward iterator</i>, <i>assignable</i>) described by the C++
      standard. Documentation may simply refer to an already named Concept,
      either in the standard or elsewhere. It is a grave error for a template to
      exploit an operation not listed, because the compiler may not report the
      misuse.

      <p>
      10.5. <b>Implementation notes</b> appear separately from public interface
      and derivation interface documentation, preferably not in the header
      file. These include a concise and complete list of <b>class
      invariants</b>, preferably in a form that can be verified by
      assertions. <a name="class_invariant">A class invariant is a condition
      guaranteed on entry to any public or protected member function, and

      <p>
      11.1. <b>Be conscious of and maintain your <a
      href="#class_invariant">class invariants</a></b>.  Be sure that if an
      error occurs your objects are in a "valid state". For example, a class
      containing two arrays which are always supposed to be the same length must
      maintain that condition even if it runs out of memory when trying to grow
      one of the arrays. Sometimes this involves a ``rollback action''.

      <p>
      11.2. <b>Encapsulate the ownership of every resource</b> with an
      appropriate resource-owning object. This is essential to exception-safety
      and helps clarify code by reducing the number of try/catch
      blocks. Existing classes provided by the standard (<tt>std::auto_ptr</tt>)
      and the boost library cover most of what you might want already.

      <p>
      11.3. <b>Document transfer-of-ownership.</b> Using <tt>std::auto_ptr</tt>
      is the best way; it simplifies function naming and enforces correctness in
      code. When std::auto_ptr is inappropriate, name prefixes like
      <tt>create_</tt> and <tt>adopt_</tt> can help.

      <p>
      11.4. <b>Use <tt>assert()</tt> (or a suitable alternative) liberally to
      detect unsatisfied preconditions and programming errors</b>. A
      precondition is a condition which must be true before a function can be
      called. Each time you write a function, ask yourself ``what am I assuming
      about the parameters to this function?'', and <tt>assert()</tt> each of
      your assumptions. For example, if you've implemented an array class with a
      function <tt>get_nth(int&nbsp;index)</tt>, you'll want to assert that
      index is non-negative and less than the length of the array. In these
      cases it may also sometimes be appropriate to throw an exception.

      <p>
      11.5. <b>Use exceptions to report error conditions which can't be
      reasonably or efficiently checked by the caller.</b> Usually these are
      resource allocation failures such as out-of-memory or file-unavailable
      conditions.

      <p>
      11.6.        <b>When a function throws an exception it should have no
      effects</b>, if possible.  In other words, the program state should be
      returned to a condition indistinguishable from what it was before the
      function was called. This is known as the <i>strong guarantee</i>.
      Functions giving the strong guarantee do not need to be specially
      commented to take note of that fact.

      <p>
      11.7.  <b>Any functions which do not give the <i>strong guarantee</i> must
      still give the <i>basic guarantee</i></b> that invariants are preserved
      and no resources are leaked. Functions giving the basic
      guarantee should be prominently commented to take note of that fact. The
      words ``basic guarantee only'' are sufficient.

      <p>
      11.8.        <b>Provide the <i>no-throw</i> (failsafe) guarantee on
      functions used for recovery.</b> Try to anticipate which functionality
      might be needed for rollback of complex operations, and provide an
      additional, documented guarantee that no exceptions will be thrown. 

      <p>
      11.9.        <b>Make exceptions descendants of std::exception.</b> This
      simplifies error reporting by providing a common interface through which
      information about the error can be retrieved. It is fine to extend the
      interface of std::exception in your derived class if additional info, such
      as OS error codes, is available.

      <p>
      11.10. <b>Do not throw types whose copy constructor may throw an
      exception.</b> A thrown object is immediately copied into a special memory
      area by the implementation. If an exception is thrown at that point,
      <tt>terminate()</tt> will be called. That's probably not what you meant!
      <i>Resist the tempation to include a std::string member in your exception
      object, since its copy constructor may throw!</i> A statically-sized array
      of characters or a <tt>boost::shared_ptr&lt;std::string&gt;</tt> may be
      used instead. Note that constructing a type with a throwing constructor at
      the point of error detection may cause the error to be mis-reported.

      <p>
      11.11.    <b>Do not allow exceptions to escape from destructors.</b> This
      results in immediate termination if the exception is thrown during stack
      unwinding.

      <p>
      11.12.    <b>Beware <tt>std::uncaught_exception()</tt>.</b> It doesn't
      tell you whether exception recovery is in process, so you can't use it to
      determine if throwing an exception is actually safe.

      <p>
      11.13.    <b>Do not use exception specifications</b>,
      e.g. <tt>void f() <u>throw(std::exception)</u></tt>. Exception
      specifications provide no compile-time safety, and instead terminate your
      program at runtime when violated. If you wish to document what a function
      can throw, use a comment instead. You may use <i>empty</i>
      exception-specifications (i.e. <tt>throw()</tt>) on functions which do not
      throw exceptions; some compilers will make optimizations based on this
      information. In this case the exception-specification should be generated
      by a standard macro (e.g. <tt>ALTRA_NO_THROW</tt>) which can be made empty
      for compilers which ``pessimize'' code with
      exception-specifications.

      <p>
      11.14.    <b>Understand the
      real consequences of 
      new(nothrow).</b> While it guarantees that no exception will occur
      due to memory allocation, the constructor may still yield an exception.
      In general, you can't use this construct to suppress exceptions in
      dynamic allocation.

      <p>
      11.15.    <b>Do not expect
      throwing an exception to be efficient.</b> It is inappropriate to use
      exceptions to report errors which will happen very often in
      efficiency-critical sections of code. Searching a string for a character
      by throwing an exception each time the character is not found is an
      extreme example.

      <p>
      11.16.    <b>Step through each
      line of code you write or change in a debugger</b>. This includes
      error-handling code. It is OK to artificially stimulate error conditions
      for debugging purposes. See ``Writing Solid Code.''

      <h3><a name="AEN320">Discussion:</a></h3>

      <p>Invariants provide maximally concise documentation of the usage
      pattern of data members in the various member functions, so that not all
      members need be studied in detail before modifying one of them.

      <p>Use of explicit Class Invariants is among the most powerful tools
      known for improving C++ code quality. Assertions which express invariants
      make testing much more likely to detect errors. Difficulty expressing
      concise invariants may indicate design problems, so minimizing one's list
      of invariants is part of design optimization. The earlier invariants are
      codified, the more useful they are.

      <p>Invariants are important for exception safety, as they provide a
      checklist of conditions which must be restored to enable safe re-entry
      after an exception.

      <p>Throwing an exception when you can't meet a postcondition
      (fulfill a request) is actually a service to your client -- the
      alternative is usually the imposition of additional preconditions on
      client code.

      <p>
      std::uncaught_exception returns false inside of catch blocks, so
      if a function tries to use this to determine if an exception should be
      thrown, and this function is called from a catch block, the original
      exception caught will be discarded and replaced by the new one. Later
      actions in the catch block will be skipped.

      <p>A few compilers can optimize exception tables away when a cascade of
      function calls have nondecreasingly strict exception-specifications. With
      these compilers, it might be a good bet to use empty
      exception-specifications on functions that don't throw, like
      destructors -- these are easy enough to keep track of. Of course,
      use of this optimization is highly non-portable, and will often have the
      opposite effect on other compilers, since they must generate an implicit
      try/catch block to implement the run-time termination behavior when an
      exception specification is violated.

      <p>
      12.2.        <b>Each module should be in a separate sub-namespace.</b> To

      12.5.        <b>Avoid the standard 'C' headers.</b> The standard 'C'
      headers (e.g. <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>) put names into the global

      which imports all names from <tt>std</tt> into the global namespace. Every
      standard 'C' header has a C++ counterpart which puts its names into
      namespace <tt>std</tt>. Simply remove the '.h' suffix and add a 'c'
      prefix. So <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt> becomes <tt>&lt;cstdio&gt;</tt> and

      <p>Visible action is better than invisible action.

      <p>Implicit conversions are far more frequently a cause of invisible bugs
      and troublesome ambiguities than they are a convenience for users.
      Besides providing invisible conversion paths creating usually-unwanted
      temporaries, conversions may make it harder to call the correct one of a
      set of overloaded functions.

      <p>One place where experience has shown implicit conversions to be
      advantageous is in interfacing with older code. Implicit conversion can
      allow a safer type to act as a drop-in replacement for another which
      fills the same role. This should only be used as a transitional
      technique, if at all. A correct long-term strategy would be to write a
      wrapper for the old interface which uses the safer type in place of the
      other.

      <p>Because template function argument type deduction cannot take
      advantage of conversions, otherwise-useful conversions often are not
      usable in code that uses templates. In such a context explicit casts are
      often the alternative.

      <p>Explicit casts introduce risk because it is easy to use the wrong cast
      accidentally, and the compiler won't help. Explicit conversion functions
      don't suffer these problems.

      <p>A conversion to operator bool() is also a conversion to int, char, and
      double, since bool participates in promotion. If a type absolutely must be
      used in a conditional context (this is rare; generally, such a type should
      have no other purpose) it should instead convert to
      <tt>void&nbsp;const*</tt>, which doesn't implicitly promote to other
      types.

      <h2><a name="misc">15. Miscellaneous</a></h2>

      15.1. <b>Use the standard library.</b> If functionality is provided

      or using some other library.

      <p>
      15.2. <b>Don't use functions which accept variable numbers of
      arguments</b> (e.g. the printf() family of functions). These functions are
      not typesafe at compile-time <i>or</i> at runtime, and even if you get
      them right are not resilient to changing types during program
      maintenance. Better alternatives are families of overloaded functions and

      <p>
      15.3.  <b>Avoid <tt>std::endl</tt></b> unless you really mean it.
      <tt>std::endl</tt> is exactly like <tt>"\n"</tt> except that it flushes
      the output buffer. This results in bigger code because it becomes a
      separate function call, slower code because it subverts buffering. You
      might want to use it when generating debug output, to be sure that output
      is flushed before a hypothetical crash, but simply embedding <tt>"\n"</tt>
      in an output string usually works better. Note that <tt>std::cerr</tt> is

      15.4. <b>Derive classes from <tt>boost::noncopyable</tt></b> if you

      either consider the results or disallow copying.

      <p>
      15.5. <b>Beware reference data members.</b> A reference used as a data
