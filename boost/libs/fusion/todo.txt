* Consider object equivalent of functions and algorithms (so you can do transform(iterators, deref()) with needing to put together a wrapper for deref).
* Consider segmented sequence / algorithm support
* Consider utility element_ref<Seq,Member>::type thats consts and refs as appropriate
* Improved motivation section
* Expand details of view concept
* Examples, examples, examples
* look at lambda stuff
