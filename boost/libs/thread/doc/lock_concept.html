<p>The purpose of a lock concept is to provide an exception safe means for acquiring and 
releasing a <a href="mutex_concept.html">mutex model</a>.  In other words they are an
implementation of the <i>Scoped Locking</i><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> pattern.</p>

<p>Lock models are constructed with a reference to a <a href="mutex_concept.html">mutex model</a>
and typically acquire ownership of the <a href="mutex_concept.html">mutex model</a> by setting
its state to locked. They also insure ownership is relinquished in the destructor. Lock
models also expose methods to query the lock status and to manually lock and unlock the
<a href="mutex_concept.html">mutex model</a>.</p>

<p>Instances of lock models are meant to be short lived, expected to be used at block scope
only. In particular it should be noted that lock models are not <a href="file:///c:/boost/site/libs/thread/doc/thread_formal_definition.html#Thread-safe">thread-safe</a>.  Lock models
must maintain state to indicate whether or not they've been locked and this state is not
protected by any synchronization concepts. For this reason an instance of a lock model
should never be shared between multiple threads.</p>

<p><b>Boost.Threads</b> provides three templates used to expose lock models for specific
<a href="mutex_concept.html">mutex models</a>: <a href="basic_lock.html">basic_lock</a>,
<a href="basic_trylock.html">basic_trylock</a> and
<a href="basic_timedlock.html">basic_timedlock</a>.</p>
