<h2>Are lock objects thread safe?</h2>

<p><b>No!</b>  Lock objects are not meant to be shared between threads.  They are meant to
be short lived objects created on automatic storage within a code block.  Any other usage
is just likely to lead to errors and won't really be of actual benefit any way.  Share
mutexes, not locks.  For more information on this see the documentation on the
<a href="rationale.html#lock_objects">rationale</a> behind the design for lock objects.</p>

<h2>Why was Boost.Threads modelled after the (platform specific library name)
library?</h2>

<p>It wasn't.  As the developer I tried very hard to not let my own biases show in the
development of this library.  Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses and I wanted
to avoid the mistakes made by others (though I'm sure I made plenty of my own).  For instance,
inclusion of a max value for semaphores seemed like a smart decision despite the lack of support
for this concept in POSIX.  On the other hand, lack of a condition variable concept in the
Windows API was a big mistake since it's the only way to model a monitor pattern.  If you think
you see a bias for any platform/library, you're probably wrong.</p>
