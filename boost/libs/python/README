To build using g++:
===================

> setenv CXX g++ 
>
> ./configure \
    --with-pythoninc=/usr/local/include/python1.5 \ 
    --with-extra-includes=/usr/local/STLport
>
> make install
   
where 
    --with-pythoninc: the directory where 'Python.h' lives
    --with-extra-includes: the directory where STLport includes 
        or the 'limits' header are
        

To build using another compiler:
================================

> setenv CXX CC  # your compiler
>
> ./configure \
    --with-pythoninc=/usr/local/include/python1.5 \ 
    --enable-shared-linker=-G \
    --enable-position-independent-code=-pic
>
> make install
    
where 
    --with-pythoninc: as above
    --enable-shared-linker: flag that tells the compiler to build a
            shared library (needed for Python modules)
    --enable-position-independent-code: flag that tells the compiler 
            to create position independent code (needed for shared linking)

        
more options:
=============

> ./configure --help

of particular interest are:

  --libdir: the install directory for 'libboostpython.a'
  --enable-shared-library-extension: the file extension for shared libraries  

for most options, configure provides reaonable defaults, given in brackets
