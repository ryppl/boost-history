\begin{abstract} $\!$This paper describes the Boost \Cpp template
metaprogramming library (\mpl), an extensible compile-time framework
of algorithms, sequences and function classes. The library brings
together important abstractions from the generic and functional
programming worlds to build a powerful and easy-to-use
metaprogramming toolset which makes template metaprogramming practical
enough for the real-world environments. The MPL is heavily influenced
by its run-time equivalent - the Standard Template Library (STL), a
part of the C++ standard library. Like the STL, it defines an open
conceptual and implementation framework which can serve as a
foundation for future contributions in the domain. The library's
fundamental concepts and idioms enable the user to focus on solutions 
without navigating the universe of possible ad-hoc approaches to a 
given metaprogramming problem, even if no actual MPL code is used. 
{\mpl} also provides a compile-time lambda expression facility enabling
arbitrary currying and composition of class templates, a feature whose
runtime counterpart is often cited as missing from the STL. This paper
explains motivation, usage, design, and implementation of \mpl 
library, gives some advanced examples of its real-life applications, 
and offers some lessons learned about C++ template metaprogramming.
