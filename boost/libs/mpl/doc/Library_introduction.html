<h1><a href="./Table_of_Content.html"><img src="./mpl_logo.jpg" alt="[Home]" border=0 align="right"></a>Library introduction</h1>Metaprogramming is the activity of creating programs that manipulate other programs or themselves. Any program that takes (other) program as its input and produces (yet another) program as the result of its execution is an example of metaprogram. Compilers, interpreters, preprocessors and program generators are all examples of metaprograms. Metaprogramming is central to automating the process of building software; it helps to relieve the programmer from all repetitive and conceptually redundant operations, so that he may focus on the essence of programming, that is, on the problems that have never been solved yet [<a href="#1">1</a>]. 
<p>
Although is is possible, in almost any programming language, to create programs that manipulate other programs at runtime, there are few languages that support compile-time metaprogramming.

<h3>Key features of the library:
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A conceptual/syntactical similarity with the STL; the algorithms and idioms which programmers already know from STL can be applied again at compile-time.
<li>Algorithms can be used with different compile-time sequence structures and implementations
<li><a href="./Function_classes_composition.html">Function classes composition</a>
<li>[Argument binding]<a href="./action=edit&id=Argument_binding.html">?</a>
<li><a href="./Expression_templates.html">Expression templates</a>
<li>A convenient way to specify type lists without macros
</ul>
