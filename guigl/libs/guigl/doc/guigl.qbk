[section Introduction]

[guigl] is a modular GUI library tbat uses OpenGL.  It's development was
inspired by the [@http://mat.ucsb.edu/glv/ GLV library].  The major design goals
of guigl are:

* To provide a basic set of GUI elements / widgets.
* To allow easy creation of new GUI elements / widgets through code reuse.
* To maximally use the [boost] libraries for anything not directly reated to
  GUI functionality.

[guigl] provides a number of widgets and related functionality that can be used
to create a user interface.  New widgets can be created by reusing and extending
the functionality provided by atomic /view behaviors/.  Each /view behavior/ can
change the way the widget looks and/or change the way in which the widget responds
to user interaction.  Behaviors can also add member functions and variables
to the widget, which can be used by other view behavior code or user code.

Currently, [guigl] uses OpenGL for drawing and GLUT (or any library that
provides a GLUT compatibility layer) as its window manager.
