# C|1071099907|stephend|/cvs|Sources/Scripts/buildbot|bonsai.py|1.2|||18|7
# A|1071099907|stephend|/cvs|Sources/Scripts/buildbot|master.cfg|1.1|||18|7
# R|1071099907|stephend|/cvs|Sources/Scripts/buildbot|BuildMaster.py|||
# LOGCOMMENT
# Updated bonsai parser and switched master config to buildbot-0.4.1 style.
# 
# :ENDLOGCOMMENT
#
# In the first example line, stephend is the user, /cvs the repository,
# buildbot the directory, bonsai.py the file, 1.2 the revision, no sticky
# and branch, 18 lines added and 7 removed. All of these fields might not be
# present (during "removes" for example).
#
# There may be multiple "control" lines or even none (imports, directory
# additions) but there is one email per directory. We only care about actual
# changes since it is presumed directory additions don't actually affect the
# build. At least one file should need to change (the makefile, say) to
# actually make a new directory part of the build process. That's my story
# and I'm sticking to it.
