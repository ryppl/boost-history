[section:changes  Appendix A: History]

[heading [*Version 0.3, January 19, 2009] Asynchronous execution and test on more toolsets]

[*Features:]

* fork_after: request the AE to execute a function asynchronously once each one of ACTs in the dependency tuple parameter are ready.
* Add act traits, as value type, is movable, has_future_if, has_thread_if
 

[heading [*Version 0.2, January 14, 2009] Asynchronous execution and test on more toolsets]

[*Features:]

* Asynchronous executors (AE) and asynchronous completion token (ACT) framework
    * fork and fork_all functions
    * wait_for_all, wait_for_any functions
    * set_all, join_all, ...
* unique/shared threader (AE) and unique/shared joiner(ACT) classes
* basic_threader(AE) class
* unique/shared launcher(AE) class
* scheduler(AE) class (working with tp::pool(AE) and tp::task (ACT))
* thread_decorator can now decorate a nullary function in addition to a callable function
* asynchronous_executor_decorator mixin allows to decorate the functions launched by an asynchronous executor
* Boost.Typeof registration for the ACT classes
* The AE/ACT framework comes with significant tests

[*Toolsets:]

* Tested on Linux gcc 3.4.6.
* Tested on Linux gcc 4.1.2.
* Modification helping Windows (not tested)

[*Closed Bugs:]

* basic_keep_alive example do not link.

[heading [*Version 0.1, November 30, 2008] ['Announcement of Interthreads]]

[*Features:]

* thread setup/cleanup decorator, 
* thread specific shared pointer, 
* thread keep alive mechanism, 
* thread tuples, set_once synchonizer, thread_tuple_once and thread_group_once.
 
[heading [*Bugs:]]

[*v0.3#3: scheduler::do_test_fork_after_wait do not work yet.]
[*v0.3#2: scheduler::do_test_fork_after_get do not work yet.]
[*v0.3#1: scheduler::do_test_wait_for_any do not work yet.]

[*v0.2#2: Some trouble with the use of tp::pool directly, use scheduler instead.]
[*v0.2#1: ae::get_all do not work yet, use set_all instead.] 
get_all do not work because fusion transform sequence function can not take non const sequences.
Maybe we can emulate it using set_all and a mpl a transformation for a tuple of ACT to a tuple of result_type.

CLOSED [*v0.1#1: basic_keep_alive example do not link.]
