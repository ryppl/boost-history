[heading Description]
[/==================]

__boost_interthreads__ extends __boost_thread__ adding some features:

* A thread_decoration class allowing to define setup/cleanup functions which will be called only once by thread (if
the thread function is decorated with thread_decorator): setup before the thread function and cleanup at thread exit.
It is used together with asynchronous_executor_decorator

* A thread_decorator/thread_decorate class/function which decorate a thread function in order to call the setup and the
cleanup of all the thread_decorations.

* A thread specific shared pointer which is an extension of the thread_specific_ptr providing access
to this thread specific context from other threads.
As it is shared the stored pointer is a shared_ptr instead of a raw one.

* A thread keep alive mechanism: this mechanism allows to detect threads that do not prove that they are alive by
calling to the keep_alive_point regularly.
When a thread is declared dead a user provided function is called, which by default will abort the program.

* A thread static array
    * thread tuple: defines a thread groupe where the number of threads is know statically and the threads are
created at construction time in oposition to a thread_group.

* A thread static array and a thread group with wait for any feature
    * set_once: a synchonizer that allows to set a variable only once, notifying to the variable value to whatever is waiting for that.

    * thread_tuple_once: an extension of the boost::thread_tuple which allows to join the completion of any thread using for that the set_once synchronizer.

    * thread_group_once: an extension of the boost::thread_group which allows to join the completion of any thread in the group  using for that the set_once synchronizer.

[note  thread_decorator and thread_specific_shared_ptr are based on the original implementation of [@http://www.boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?directory=Concurrent%20Programming [*threadalert]]

[heading How to Use This Documentation]
[/====================================]

This documentation makes use of the following naming and formatting conventions.

* Code is in `fixed width font` and is syntax-highlighted.
* Replaceable text that you will need to supply is in [~italics].
* If a name refers to a free function, it is specified like this:
  `free_function()`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `()`
  to indicate that it is a free function.
* If a name refers to a class template, it is specified like this:
  `class_template<>`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `<>`
  to indicate that it is a class template.
* If a name refers to a function-like macro, it is specified like this: `MACRO()`;
  that is, it is uppercase in code font and its name is followed by `()` to
  indicate that it is a function-like macro. Object-like macros appear without the
  trailing `()`.
* Names that refer to /concepts/ in the generic programming sense are
  specified in CamelCase.

[note In addition, notes such as this one specify non-essential information that
provides additional background or rationale.]

Finally, you can mentally add the following to any code fragments in this document:

    // Include all of InterThreads
    #include <boost/interthreads/interthreads.hpp>

    // Create a namespace aliases
    namespace bith = boost::interthreads;
