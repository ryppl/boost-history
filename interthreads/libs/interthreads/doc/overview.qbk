[heading Description]
[/==================]

__boost_interthreads__ extends __boost_thread__ adding some features:

* threader/joiner: A Threader runs a unary function in its own thread. A Joiner is used to synchronise with and pick
up the result from the unary function.

* thread decorator: thread_decorator allows to define setup/cleanup functions which will be called only once by thread: 
setup before the thread function and cleanup at thread exit. 

* thread specific shared pointer: this is an extension of the thread_specific_ptr providing access 
to this thread specific context from other threads.
As it is shared the stored pointer is a shared_ptr instead of a raw one.

* thread keep alive mechanism: this mechanism allows to detect threads that do not prove that they are alive by 
calling to the keep_alive_point regularly. 
When a thread is declared dead a user provided function is called, which by default will abort the program.

* thread tuple: defines a thread groupe where the number of threads is know statically and the threads are 
created at construction time. 

* set_once: a synchonizer that allows to set a variable only once, notifying 
to the variable value to whatever is waiting for that.

* thread_tuple_once: an extension of the boost::thread_tuple which allows to join the thread finishing 
the first, using for that the set_once synchronizer.

* thread_group_once: an extension of the boost::thread_group which allows to join the thread finishing 
the first, using for that the set_once synchronizer.

thread_decorator and thread_specific_shared_ptr are based on the original implementation of 
[@http://www.boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?directory=Concurrent%20Programming [*threadalert]] 
written by Roland Schwarz.

threader/joiner are based on the original idea of Kevlin Henney

[heading How to Use This Documentation]
[/====================================]

This documentation makes use of the following naming and formatting conventions.

* Code is in `fixed width font` and is syntax-highlighted.
* Replaceable text that you will need to supply is in [~italics].
* If a name refers to a free function, it is specified like this:
  `free_function()`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `()` 
  to indicate that it is a free function.
* If a name refers to a class template, it is specified like this:
  `class_template<>`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `<>` 
  to indicate that it is a class template.
* If a name refers to a function-like macro, it is specified like this: `MACRO()`;
  that is, it is uppercase in code font and its name is followed by `()` to
  indicate that it is a function-like macro. Object-like macros appear without the 
  trailing `()`.
* Names that refer to /concepts/ in the generic programming sense are
  specified in CamelCase.

[note In addition, notes such as this one specify non-essential information that
provides additional background or rationale.]

Finally, you can mentally add the following to any code fragments in this document:

    // Include all of InterThreads
    #include <boost/interthreads/interthreads.hpp>

    // Create a namespace aliases
    namespace bith = boost::interthreads;
