[section Tasks to do before review]


[heading Complete the tests]

Even if the current release include some test there is yet a long way before been able to review the library.]]

* change the test so they take less time using locks; conditions and variables.
* Add test with functions throwing
* Formalize the tests for thread_decoratoor
* Formalize the tests for thread_specific_shared_ptr
* Add tests for keep alive mechanism

[heading Add more examples]

* Complete the STM example.
* Change the implementation of the file on the async_ostream.

[heading Change the rational and implementation sections]

[section For later releases]

[heading Add C++0x move semantics on compilers supporting it and use the Boost.Move emulation otherwise]

[heading Use C++0x variadic templates on compilers supporting it and use the preprocesor otherwise]

[heading Use C++0x Concepts on compilers supporting them and use the Boost.ConceptCheck or Boost.ConceptTraits otherwise]

[heading Add a daemon controlling all the keep alive controller threads]
This daemon will send regular keep_alive messages and kill the process when dead.

[heading Optimize the TSSS maps using intrusive containers]

[heading Generalize both specific pointers in a template class basic_thread_specific_ptr]

[*Domain Features]

[variablelist

[[ownership: exclusive/shared] [Specifies if the pointer is exclusive to the thread or shared with other threads.]]

[[key range: fixed/variable/mixed ] [Specifies how the key range is defined. fixed has an integer range 0..n, variable takes as key the address of the specific_ptr and mixed use a variant of fixed or variable key.]]

[[key creation: eager/lazy] [Specifies how the key is created, eager at construction time, lazy when needed.]]

[[context setting: eager/lazy] [Specifies how the pointer is set, eager at thread initialization time, lazy when needed.]]

]

The current `thread_specific_ptr` is exclusive, has a variable key range and so the key is initialized at construction time and
explicit context setting by user on the current thread.

    typedef basic_thread_specific_ptr<exclusive, variable_key_range<>, eager_context_setting> thread_specific_ptr;

The current `thread_specific_shared_ptr` is shared, has a variable key range and so the key is initialized at construction time and
explicit context setting by user on the current thread.

    typedef basic_thread_specific_ptr<exclusive, variable_key_range<>, eager_context_setting> thread_specific_ptr;

[*Design rationale]

`boost::thread_specific_ptr` uses as key the address of the variable. This has as consequence that
the mapping from keys to the thread specific context pointer is much less efficient that the direct access provided
by some implementations. In this concern this library would try to improve the performance to this mapping providing
direct access keys. As the number of direct access keys must be know at compile time this has a limit on the number
of thread specific pointers. A mixed approach would be also provided in which the key could be a fixed one or a
variable one. It is up to the user to give an hint of the key sort.
When using fixed or mixed keys, there is decision to take related to when the key is created, i.e. eager before the
threads starts or lazy when we need it.

Non-portable: The interfaces of POSIX Pthreads, Solaris threads, and Win32 threads are very similar. However,
the semantics of Win32 threads are subtly different since they do not provide a reliable means of cleaning up objects
allocated in thread-specific storage when a thread exits. Moreover, there is no API to delete a key in Solaris
threads. This makes it hard to write portable code among UNIX and Win32 platforms.

So we need to implement it on top of the underlying OS. The idea is to take a native thread specific pointer which
will manage with the fixed, variable and mixed keys. This exactly the approach of `boost::thread_specific_ptr` but
only for variable keys.

Just to finish, we need to decide when the context is set, two possibilities: the user sets explicitlly the context
when it considers pertinent or the context is created lazily the first time we try to get it. The first approach has
the liability that the user needs to ensure that the context is set before get them, but when the context must be set
before the function thread starts this is a no issue. The second is safe but has as consequence that every access
include a check. In addition the type must be default constructible.

    bith::thread_specific_shared_ptr<myclass, lazy_setting> ptr;

The pointer will be initilaized when needed as if we had do

    if (ptr.get()==0) {
        ptr.reset( new myclass() );
    }

Between the features:

Thread_specific key mapping optimization: Replace the Boost.Thread thread_specific_ptr thread specific key mapping implementation
by a mix of fixed/variable mapping which will provide efficient access to the fixed keys and scalability with the
others keys.

Configuration the fixed/variable/mixed key range, ordered/unordered map, intrusive/extrusive map, shared/exclusive locking.
