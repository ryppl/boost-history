This is the Variadic Macro Data library, or VMD for short. 
The Variadic Macro Data library is a library 
of macros which provide important functionality for variadic 
macros as well as integrating variadic macros with the Boost 
preprocessor library ( Boost PP ). It integrates with Boost PP 
without changing the latter library in any way.

work for a living.

You can also of course use the Boost newsgroups 
to ask questions and make comments or suggestions 
about the library.
