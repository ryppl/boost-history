<p>
      The initial impetus for creating this library was entirely practical. I had
      been working on another library of macro functionality, which used Boost PP
      functionality, and I realized that if I could use variadic macros with my other
      library, the end-user usability for that library would be easier. Therefore
      the main design goal of this library is to interoperate variadic macro data
      with Boost PP in the easiest and clearest way possible.
    </p>
<p>
      I also wanted to make the library as orthogonal and as easy to use as possible.
      Because of this, there is functionality in this library that is really not
      necessary for someone knowledgable about Boost PP, but it is included in the
      library even though it is just a convenient shorthand for functionality in
      Boost PP combined with new functionality in this library. This includes a number
      of the conversions back and forth between variadic macro data and Boost PP
      data types as well as nearly all of the specific Boost PP tuple functionality.
      As long as there is no run-time programming overhead, and a minimum of compile-time
      overhead, I value ease of use to be much more important than redundancy, so
      I added the functionality to this library.
