[section:vmd_vmacros Variadic Macros]

Variadic macros, as specified by C++0x, is a feature taken from the C99 
specification. They are macros which take a final parameter denoted as 
'...' which represents one or more final arguments to the macro as a 
series of comma-separated tokens. In the macro expansion a special 
keyword of '__VA_ARGS__' represents the comma-separated tokens. This 
information when passed to a variadic macro I call 'variadic macro data',
which gives its name to this library. C99, and by implication C++0x, 
provides no built-in way of accessing a single token from the 
comma-separated list of variadic macro data. But this library does 
provide a means to do that among its other functionality.

[section:vmd_vmacros_Boost Boost support]

Boost until recently has had no generic support for variadic macros 
based on the ability of a given compiler/version to support C99's variadic 
macros. This support has now been added to the trunk in the form of 
a macro which denotes that compiler support for variadic macros does not exist. 
This macro is BOOST_NO_VARIADIC_MACROS. The variadic macro data library 
will only work for a compiler/version combination when BOOST_NO_VARIADIC_MACROS 
is not defined.
