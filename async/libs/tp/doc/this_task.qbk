[section:this_task Namespace this_task]
In the function `boost::this_task::reschedule_until( Pred const&)` allows to synchronize the task with other
asynchronous events without blocking the __worker_threads__ (bool Pred::operator()() must not block)
The current task will be rescheduled until the passed predicate becomes true.
The pool can be accessed via `boost::this_task::get_thread_pool< Pool >()` if the calling code is executed by a __worker_thread__.
`boost::this_task::s_worker()` evaluates true if the current thread is __worker_thread__ and `boost::this_task::worker_id()`
returns the thread id.
