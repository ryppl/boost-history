[section Class `lock_adapter`]
[*Synopsis]

[*Description]

More usefully for primitives, which are best left as
non-polymorphic, an adaptor class can be used to provide the interface - run-time
polymorphism - on behalf of anything supporting the correctly named functions -
sometimes known as compile time polymorphism. It easier to take a nonpolymorphic
class and adapt it to be polymorphic, than it is do it the other way
around: the overhead and semantics of polymorphism can only introduced to a class,
not removed.

[section Class `adaptive_lock`]
An adaptive general locking class that defers the decision of lockable type to run time.

[*Synopsis]

[*Description]

This class, as locable, provide a set of general locking APIs.
However, it defers our decision of what kind of lockable to use to the run time and delegates
all locking operations to the actual lockable. Users must define a constructor in their subclass
to initialize lock_.
