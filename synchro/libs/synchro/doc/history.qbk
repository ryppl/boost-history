[section [*Version 0.3.1, Mars 29, 2009] ['Language-like Synchronized Block Macros]]

[*New Features:]

* Language-like Synchronized Block Macros.

[section [*Version 0.3.0, Mars 19, 2009] ['Generic free operations on multiple lockables + Usage of Boost.Chrono]]

[*New Features:]

* Generic free functions on lockables: `lock`, `try_lock` 

* Complete the generic free functions on multiple lockables in Boost.Thread `lock`, `try_lock` with:
    * `lock_until`, `lock_for`, `try_lock_until`, `try_lock_for`, `unlock`

[section [*Version 0.2.0, Mars 1, 2009] ['binary_semaphore + array_locker]]

[*New Features:]

* `binary_semaphore` emulation with mutex
* `array_locker` locker containers.
 
[endsect]
[section [*Version 0.1.0, Febraury 16, 2009] ['Announcement of Synchro]]

[*Features:]

* A uniform usage of Boost.Thread and Boost.Interprocess synchronization mechanisms based on lockables(mutexes) concepts and locker(guards) concepts.

    * lockables traits and lock generators, 
    * lock adapters of the Boost.Thread and Boost.Interprocess lockable models,
    * locker adapters of the Boost.Thread and Boost.Interprocess lockers models,
    * complete them with the corresponding models for single-threaded programms: `null_mutex` and `null_condition` classes,
    * locking families,
    * `semaphore`, 
    * `condition_lockable` lock put toghether a lock and its associated conditions.

* Exception based timed lockables and lockers,

* A rich palete of lockers as

    * `strict_locker`, `nested_strict_locker`,
    * `condition_locker`,
    * `reverse_locker`, `nested_reverse_locker`,
    * `locking_ptr`, `on_derreference_locking_ptr`,
    * `externally_locked`,
    
* A polymorphic lockable hierarchy.

* High-level abstractions for handling more complicated synchronization problems, including
    * `monitor` for guaranteeing exclusive access to an object, and
    * a so-called rendezvous mechanism for handling direct communication between objects `concurrent_components` via `ports` using an accept-synchronize protocol based on the design of the concurrency library in the Beta language.
