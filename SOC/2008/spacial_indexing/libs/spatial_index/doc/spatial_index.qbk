[section:introduction Introduction]

Spatial indexes are data structures optimized for spatial oriented queries. The
classic index structures (i.e. a binary tree) aren't spatially enabled, they 
have different ordering criteria but none of them relates to topological 
properties.

Bosot.SpatialIndex aims to implement spatial indexes as part of the Geometry 
Library proposal that Barend Gehrels is preparing for Boost. Nowadays, the 
library supports Quadtree and rTree indexes. Details of the strengths of 
each one will be detailed afterwards.

The scope of these structures is really wide, from collision detection for
games to geometry indexing for GIS software.
