</div>
</div>
<p> The Geometry Library provides a generic implementation of
geometry algorithms. Besides the algorithms it defines the basic
geometry classes (point, linestring, polygon) which are kept small and
simple. The algorithms include some well-known and often needed algorithms
as point-in-polygon, polygon area, point-to-point distance, point-to-line distance,
line clipping and polygon clipping.
</p>
<p> The implementation is as generic as possible. The algorithms
work, of course, on the geometry classes provided by the library, but
they also work&nbsp;on geometry classes defined by the
library user.
</p>
<p> The library follows conventions used in the std:: library and
in the boost:: libraries. It also follows, where possible, the OGC
names and conventions. OGC is the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium</a>,
the standardization committee on GIS (Geographical Information
Systems). OGC geometries are used in many environments, among others in
databases (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL). OGC specifies a library based on
inheritance, as opposed to this library, which is a template library
where&nbsp;data classes are strictly
separated from the algorithms. Therefore it is not an OGC
implementation (but an OGC implementation could be built with this
library).
</p>
<p> The library interface functions and classes are defined in
namespace <code class="computeroutput">geometry</code>.</p><div class="titlepage">

</div>
</div>
 <p>Geodan started in 1995 with a Geographic Library, called geolib.
Since then hundreds of projects have been done using this geolib, and
the geolib have been extended to fit the needs of its users. Geolib can
be used in different environments: in Windows applications, as a DLL (ggl32.dll), in Web Map
Servers (SclMapServer), Web Feature Servers or more specific programs.</p><p>In 2007
the Geometry part was revised and completely templatized. Now that it
is clear and well designed we consider proposing the geometry part to
boost, and the boost community has expressed their interest.</p><div class="titlepage">
<div>
<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="status"></a>Status and preview</h2>
</div>
</div>
 <p>The revised Geometry Library is successfully reapplied
to&nbsp;the original geolib. All original functionality is
reimplemented. However, many OGC algorithms or geometry combinations
have never been implemented by us. For example, the distance between
two polygons has never been necessary in our environments.</p><p>If
the boost community is enthousastic about the library we consider to
implement more algorithms, or more algorithms could be implemented
because it is an Open Source process then.</p><p>The preview, placed
January 2008, doesn't contain all implemented functionality, but
probably gives enough view on the design. Algorithms using sweeping
are&nbsp;not yet ready for preview.</p><p>Besides this, things might still be adapted because of changed insight and/or because of comments from the boost community.</p><div class="titlepage">
