/*!
\defgroup intersection intersection: intersection algorithms
The intersection algorithm intersects two geometries, resulting in a third geometry. Intersection
can be implemented for OGC geometries. Besides that an often used intersection is the intersection
of a linestring or a polygon with a box. This is normally called a clip.
