[section:integral_mask integral_mask type]
[h3 Description]
The `integral_mask` type is the most basic mask type. It is used to abstract all
masks back to a simple integral type. This type is used similar to an
`integral_constant` type from the boost.type_traits library.


[h3 Template Signature]
`integral_mask` has the following template signature:
``
template <typename T, T Value>
struct integral_mask;
``
[h3 Interface]
`Integral_mask` Compile time interface. Assume that N is of type
`integral_mask<int, 16>` the type supplied here is only for example.

[table
    [[Operation][Description]]
    [[`N::value`][Returns the value associated with N (in the current case that is 16). ]]
    [[`N::value_type`][Returns the type of the value associated with N (in the current case that is int). ]]
    [[`N::type`][ Returns the current types type (using N as an example, `N::type` is equivalent to `integral_mask<int,16>` )]]
