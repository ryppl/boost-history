[section:high_bits_maskbits high_bits_mask]
[h3 Description]
THe template `high_bits_mask` preforms bitwise operations on compile time then 
exposes the newly created mask via `value` and `operator T()`. What `high_bits_mask` 
does is create a mask inside your integral type which sets all bits starting
from the left most bit reaching out width bits to the right. For example,
``
// using high bits to create a mask starting from the left most bit with a width
// of 15
typedef high_bits_mask<int, 15> bits;
// bits::value will have the following value in binary.
// 1111 1111  1111 1110  0000 0000  0000 0000
``

[h3 Template Signature]
`high_bits_mask` has the following template signature:
``
template <typename T, unsigned int Width>
struct high_bits_mask;
``

[table
    [[Parameter][Description]]
    [[`T`][ Is an integral type which the mask is to be created over. ]]
    [[`Width`][ This is the width of the mask in bits. ]]
]

[h3 Interface]
`high_bits_mask` Compile time interface. Assume that N is of type
`high_bits_mask<int, 10>` the type supplied here is only for example.

[table
    [[Operation][Description]]
    [[`N::value`][Returns the `value` associated with `N`. ]]
    [[`N::value_type`][Returns `T` which is the type associated with `value` inside `N`. ]]
    [[`N::type`][ Returns the current types type. ]]
    [[`N::width`][ Returns the integral value associated with the `width` template parameter. ]]
    [[`operator T()`][ Run time support function. All this function does is
return the value associated with the type. With the c++0x feature constexper
this function will be made fasters and more effieient.]]

[h3 Examples]
Examples and use cases related to the `high_bits_mask` template.


Exaple:
``
typedef high_bits_mask<int,4> mask;

// binary for mask::value
// 1111 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000

int integral_value = 0xc000000c;

// integral_value's binary value
// 1100 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 1100

int result = integral_value & mask();
// binary value of result
// 1100 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000

``

The implicit cast operator allows for simplicity, clairity of code. In the
above example `mask()` could be replaced with `mask::value` to achieve the same
result. The same applies to all other bitwise operators.
