[section Parameter Adjustment macros]
[h5 Template Parameter Control]
The `BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT` macro is used for controlling the max number of
template parameters that are able to be used by the `bitfield_tuple` and the
function templates and class templates relating to it. The 
`BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT` macro if definded sets the upper limit of the
`bitfield_tuple`'s template parameter's to a higher number. The max 
`BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT` can be set to is 50 and the default is 10. The side effect
of setting `BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT` can be that the `BOOST_MPL_LIMIT_VECTOR_SIZE`
vector is set to a size which is larger or equal to the value of
`BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT`. If one wishes to set the value of both
`BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT` and `BOOST_MPL_LIMIT_VECTOR_SIZE` both must be set before
the `bitfield_tuple` header file is included. Don't include <boost/mpl/vector.hpp>
before the bitfield_tuple header file if you you intend to set the
`BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT`.



Example of setting the parameter count to 11.
``
#define BOOST_BFT_PARAM_COUNT 11
#include <boost/integer/bitfield_tuple.hpp>
``
