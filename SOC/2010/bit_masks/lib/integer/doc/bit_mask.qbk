``
TEMPLATE SIGNATURE.

[table
    [[Parameter][Description]]
    [[][ ]]
    [[][ ]]

[h3 Interface]
`TYPENAME` Compile time interface. Assume that N is of type
`N TYPE` the type supplied here is only for example.

[table
    [[Operation][Description]]
    [[`N::value`][Returns the `value` associated with `N`. ]]
    [[`N::value_type`][Returns `T` which is the type associated with `value` inside `N`. ]]
    [[`N::type`][ Returns the current types type. ]]
    [[`operator T()`][ Run time support function. All this function does is
return the value associated with the type. With the c++0x feature constexper
this function will be made fasters and more effieient.]]

[h3 Examples]
Examples and use cases related to the `TYPENAME` type.


Exaple:
``
    EXAMPLE

The implicit cast operator allows for simplicity, clairity of code. In the
above example `mask()` could be replaced with `mask::value` to achieve the same
result. The same applies to all other bitwise operators.
