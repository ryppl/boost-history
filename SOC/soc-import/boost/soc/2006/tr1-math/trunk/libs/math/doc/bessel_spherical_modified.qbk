[section Modified Spherical Bessel Functions]

[caution _caution]

[heading Synopsis]

``
  #include <boost/math/special_functions/bessel_iv.hpp>

  namespace boost { namespace math {

  template <typename T>
  inline T bessel_siv(unsigned n, T x)

  }} // namespaces
``

``
  #include <boost/math/special_functions/bessel_kv.hpp>

  namespace boost { namespace math {

  template <typename T>
  inline T bessel_skv(unsigned n, T x)

  }} // namespaces
``

[heading Description and Implementation]

The computations of modified spherical Bessel functions are very
straightforward. It's just direct evaluations from their
[link sbessel_def definitions].

The function domains are ['[i n](x)]: ([^-_inf, _inf]), ['[k n](x)]: ([^-_inf, _inf]).

[note ['[i n](x)] is odd function when ['n] is even and even function
when ['n] is odd. ['[k n](x)] is neither odd function nor even function.]
