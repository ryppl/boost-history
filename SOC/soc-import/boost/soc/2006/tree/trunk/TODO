Proposal:
* Cursor validity after insertion/erasure/clearing
* balancers/augmentors for nary trees...

* formalize parameters for balancer/augmentor members. first is tree, second current cursor etc.

Implement associative containers and priority_queue specialization using searcher
Implement (binary) heap
