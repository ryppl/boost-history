<p>
This method writes a BGL graph object as an max-flow problem into an output stream in extended dimacs format (see <a href="http://www.avglab.com/andrew/CATS/maxflow_formats.htm"><TT>Goldbergs site</TT></a> for more information).
The output can be read in again using the <a href="../../../boost/graph/read_dimacs.hpp"><TT>boost/graph/read_dimacs.hpp</TT></a> method. 

<H3>Where Defined</H3>

<P>
<a href="../../../boost/graph/write_dimacs.hpp"><TT>boost/graph/write_dimacs.hpp</TT></a>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
 IN: <tt>Graph&amp; g</tt>
<blockquote>
  A directed or undirected graph.  The graph's type must be a model of
  <a href="./VertexListGraph.html">VertexListGraph</a> and <a href="./EdgeListGraph.html">EdgeListGraph</a>, as num_vertices(Graph) and num_edges(Graph) is used inside. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
</blockquote>  

 IN: <tt>CapacityMap capacity</tt>
<blockquote>
 A property map that models <a href="../../property_map/ReadablePropertyMap.html">Readable Property Map</a> whose key type is the edge descriptor of the graph and whose value type can be written to a stream. <br>
</blockquote>  

 IN: <tt>IndexMap epw</tt>
<blockquote>
 A property map that models <a href="../../property_map/ReadablePropertyMap.html">Readable Property Map</a> whose key type is the vertex descriptor of the graph and whose value type can be written to a stream. <br>
</blockquote>
  
 OUT: <tt>std::ostream&amp; out</tt>
<blockquote>
  A standard <tt>std::ostream</tt> object.
</blockquote>  

<H3>
Example 
</H3>
A short <a href="../example/read_write_dimacs-eg.cpp">example</a> which uses read_dimacs and write_dimacs is located in the examples directory.

<h3>See Also</h3>

<a href="./read_dimacs.html"><tt>read_dimacs</tt></a>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<a name="1">[1]</a> As num_edges() and num_vertices() is used inside which returns values for the unfiltered graph (instead of the filtered), this method cannot be used with a <a href="./filtered_graph.html">filtered_graph</a>See <a href="./filtered_graph.html#2">filtered_graph Note [2]</a> for the reason.
