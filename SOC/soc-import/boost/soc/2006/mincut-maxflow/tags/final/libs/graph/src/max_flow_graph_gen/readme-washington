washington.c : A C language program to generate ten types of 
             networks/graphs. Contributed by seminar students working with 
             Richard Anderson. Compatible with the DIMACS format. 
    
             To use:  cc washington.c -o gengraph
                      gengraph function arg1 arg2 arg3 

             Command line arguments have the following meanings: 
 
                      function:           index of desired graph type
                      arg1, arg2, arg3:   meanings depend on graph type
                                          (briefly listed below: see code 
                                           comments for more info) 

		 Mesh Graph:          1 rows  cols  maxcapacity 
	 	 Random Level Graph:  2 rows  cols  maxcapacity 
		 Random 2-Level Graph:3 rows  cols  maxcapacity
		 Matching Graph:      4 vertices  degree 
		 Square Mesh:         5 side  degree  maxcapacity 
		 Basic Line:          6 rows  cols  degree 
                 Exponential Line:    7 rows  cols  degree 
                 Double Exponential   8 rows  cols  degree
  		 DinicBadCase:        9 vertices 
                      (causes n augmentation phases)                 
		 GoldBadCase         10 vertices 
		 Cheryian            11 dim1 dim2  range 
                      (last 2 are bad for goldberg's algorithm)
