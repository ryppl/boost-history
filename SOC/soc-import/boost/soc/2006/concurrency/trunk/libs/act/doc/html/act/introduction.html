      With the advent of multi-core processors reaching the mainstream user along
      with the gradual tapering of the increase of individual core speeds, there
      is a growing need for high-level tools to simplify the creation of multi-threaded
      applications in order to allow for scalability of software over the years to
      come. Preferably, a solution should also allow existing code-bases to be easily
      and incrementally updated to take advantage of modern day processors, and as
      well, code which may be targetting both multi-core and single-core processors
      should not have to suffer by strictly using one model of execution. Rather,
      behavior should be toggleable on a variety of levels such that alterations
      in a small number of locations in code could change the technique used for
      execution over a large portion of a given project.
    </p>
<p>
      Boost.Act attempts to supply a solution to this problem in the form of a portable
      library which provides STL-style algorithms that can be toggled via template
      policies to execute either synchronously or in parallel, and by providing templates
      and macros to allow the creation of asynchronous functions, active objects,
      and atomic objects. In addition, Boost.Act also allows the decoupling of signaling
      function calls from their actual invocations in such a way that one may switch
      between immediate, concurrent, lazy evaluation, or a user-provided evaluation
      strategy on a case-by-case basis with potentially no runtime cost to the application.
    </p>

<p>
        For the scope of this library, a polymorphic algorithm is considered to be
        an algorithm whose model of execution may vary depending on policies passed
        prior to invocation. For example, a polymorphic algorithm may run serially
        with one policy and may internally run in parallel and rejoin with a different
        policy. Regardless of which policies are used, the same logical operation
        is performed, allowing users to switch between different execution models
        with minimal changes to code.
      </p>
<p>
        One of the fundamental components of Boost.Act is its collection of STL-style
        polymorphic algorithms. Those familiar with the STL will find themselves
        right at home, as the majority of the algorithms correspond directly with
        those in the STL and are callable in a similar manner, with the additional
        ability to toggle the execution model of the algorithm. Along with the standard
        algorithms provided by the STL, other templates are also included for the
        sole purpose of the creation of user-defined polymorphic algorithms.

<p>
        By default, Boost.Act algorithms are performed in parallel whenever possible.
        Algorithm models are types which are used as policies to alter this behavior
        when required on both a global and call-by-call level. In addition to the
        parallel algorithm model, a serial algorithm model is provided which forces
        calls to be made in a single thread. Users may also create their own algorithm
        models if the desired behavior is not provided by either of those included
        with the library.

<p>
        It is often desirable to be able to signal a function, perform other unrelated
        operations, and then eventually wait for the signaled function's completion.
        In order to provide such functionality, Boost.Act introduces the concept
        of an <code class="literal">action</code>.
      </p>
<p>
        An <code class="literal">action</code> is a type which represents a signaled operation.
        With a stored <code class="literal">action</code>, you have access to that operation
        such that you may wait for the function's completion if you need the effects
        to have taken place prior to reaching a certain point in code. Actions also
        provide an indirect interface to the result of a signaled function.
      </p>

<p>
        Much like we have a way of decoupling the signaling of a function from the
        actual invocation of that function, Boost.Act also provides a way to separate
        the signaling of intrinsic functions of a type from the invocation of such
        functions, yet guarantees the same order of execution of such functions relative
        to one another. Since the invocations of such functions are also implicitly
        serialized, it makes it easy to signal several functions which all deal with
        the same object without having to worry that one call may occur while another
        is executing, and with the guarantee that they are called in the same order
        as they were signaled.
      </p>

<p>
        Frequently when working with multithreaded applications, a need arises to
        access a single object from multiple threads. Atomic objects are objects
        whose associated operations may be safely called by any number of threads.
