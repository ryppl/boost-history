[section Worker Allocator]

A =Worker Allocator= is a type whose instances are used to create __worker__
objects which execute user-specified functions. These =Worker Allocators=
generally act as policies to higher-level types.

In order to be considered a valid =Worker Allocator=, given the variable
definitions below, the following expressions must be well-formed and have the
indicated effects.
