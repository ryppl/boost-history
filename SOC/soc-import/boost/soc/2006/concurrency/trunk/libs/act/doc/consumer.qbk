[section Consumer]

A [concept Consumer] is an object which takes in data of a single type one
instance at a time and processes it in an implementation defined-manner either
sychnronously or asynchronously with respect to the thread it is interfaced
with. In Boost.Act, models of this concept may be found as members of models of
the __consumer_allocator__ concept.

In order to be considered a valid [concept Consumer], given the variable
definitions below, the following expressions must be well-formed and have the
indicated effects.
