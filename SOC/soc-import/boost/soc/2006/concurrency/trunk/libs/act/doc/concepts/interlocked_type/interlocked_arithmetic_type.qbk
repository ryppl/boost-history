[section Interlocked Arithmetic Type]

An [concept Interlocked Arithmetic Type] is an __interlocked_type__ which
supports common arithmetic operations.

In order to be considered a valid [concept Interlocked Arithmetic Type], given
the variable definitions below, the following expressions must be well-formed
and have the indicated effects, in addition to those requirements of
__interlocked_type__. [concept Interlocked Arithmetic Types] also support
all operations specified in the C++ standard for arithmetic types. Such
operations do not imply memory barriers of any kind.
