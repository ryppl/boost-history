[section Examples]

This chapter contains a list of example programs shipped with the Boost
Process library.  These little utilities are provided to show generic use
cases of the library but are not intended to cover every tiny detail.
Please also note that, being example code, they may not do anything useful
at all other than showing how to use the library's interface.

* [@../example/generic.cpp Generic example]: This first example shows
  multiple aspects of the library.  Its main purpose is to illustrate
  general ideas before one can dive into other more complete examples.

* [@../example/command_lines.cpp Command lines]: This example shows
  multiple ways to construct a command line and why such possibilities are
  useful.
