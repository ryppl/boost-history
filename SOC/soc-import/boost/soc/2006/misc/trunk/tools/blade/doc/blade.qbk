[/ Component descriptions ]

[def __BOOST_BLADE_DESCRIPTION__ [*B]oost [*L]ibraries [*A]dvanced [*D]evelopment [*E]nvironment \n
['- The Open Source Sword]\n
Blade is a full open source development environment composed of the best tools for software
building.
]

[def __BOOST_LIBRARIES_DESCRIPTION__ Boost provides free peer-reviewed
portable C++ source libraries. They emphasize libraries that work well with
the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful,
and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. They aim to establish
'existing practice' and provide reference implementations.
]

[def __GCC_DESCRIPTION__ The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C,
C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these
languages (libstdc++, libgcj,...).
]

[def __BOOST_BUILD_DESCRIPTION__ Boost.Build is a system for large project
software construction, which is simple to use and powerfull. Boost.Build V2 is an
onging project to rewrite Boost.Build, improving design and making it more extensible.
The distinguishing features are: simple and high level target description language,
variant builds, portability, multi-project builds and extensibility.
]

[def __BOOST_WAVE_DESCRIPTION__ The Wave C++ preprocessor library uses the Spirit
parser construction library to implement a C++ lexer with ISO/ANSI Standards
conformant preprocessing capabilities. So the main goals for the Wave project are:
full conformance with the C++ standard, maximal usage of STL and/or Boost libraries,
straightforward extendability for the implementation of additional features and
building a flexible library for different C++ lexing and preprocessing needs.
]

[def __BOOST_TEST_DESCRIPTION__ The Boost Test Library provides a matched set of
components for writing test programs, organizing tests in to simple test cases and
test suites, and controlling their runtime execution.
]

[def __DOXYGEN_DESCRIPTION__ Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java,
Objective-C, Python, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C#,
and D. It is developed under Linux and Mac OS X, but is set-up to be highly portable.
As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables
for Windows are available.
]

[def __BOOST_QUICKBOOK_DESCRIPTION__ QuickBook is a WikiWiki style documentation tool
geared towards C++ documentation using simple rules and markup for simple formatting
tasks. QuickBook extends the WikiWiki concept. Like the WikiWiki, QuickBook documents
are simple text files. A single QuickBook document can generate a fully linked set of
nice HTML and PostScript/PDF documents complete with images and syntax-colorized
source code.
]

[def __BOOST_MPL_DESCRIPTION__ The Boost.MPL library is a general-purpose, high-level
C++ template metaprogramming framework of compile-time algorithms, sequences and
metafunctions. It provides a conceptual foundation and an extensive set of powerful
and coherent tools that make doing explict metaprogramming in C++ as easy and enjoyable
as possible within the current language.
]

[def __GDB_DESCRIPTION__ The GNU Debugger, usually called just GDB, is the standard
debugger for the GNU software system. It is a portable debugger that runs on many
Unix-like systems and works for many programming languages, including C, C++, and
FORTRAN.
]

[def __DDD_DESCRIPTION__ GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers
such as GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, or
the Python debugger. Besides usual front-end features such as viewing source texts,
DDD has become famous through its interactive graphical data display, where data
structures are displayed as graphs.
]

[def __PYTHON_DESCRIPTION__ Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language
that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support
for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries,
and can be learned in a few days.
]

[def __BOOST_PYTHON_DESCRIPTION__ Boost.Python version 2 is a C++ library which
enables seamless interoperability between C++ and the Python programming language.
The new version has been rewritten from the ground up, with a more convenient and
flexible interface, and many new capabilities.
]

[def __SUBVERSION_DESCRIPTION__ Subversion is an open source application used for
revision control. It is sometimes known as svn in reference to the name of its command
line interface. Subversion is designed specifically to be a modern replacement for CVS
and shares a number of the same key developers.
]

[def __TRAC_DESCRIPTION__ Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software
development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project
management. Their mission is to help developers write great software while staying out of
the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team’s established development process
and policies.

[section Acknowledgements]

Just before the Google SoC 2006 starts I spent almost a month learning the
subtle details needed to a successful install and an efficient usage of tools
like build, svn, gdb, doxygen and Quickbook. If this document had exist by
that time I surely would install and run everything easier and what is more,
I would grasp the relations between this awesome tools.

I started to write this document while I was developing Boost.Bimap. At
first __BOOST_BLADE__ was __KBLADE__ because that was the platform I was using.
In several chats, Lally Singh (that was developing the Module C++ project
for SoC too) convince me that the separation of a portable open source core
and the different IDEs was the correct direction. Thanks Lally for being
my friend during the SoC.

A lot of thanks to my Mentor during the SoC, Joaquin Lopez Muñoz that
give me the freedom to develop Blade and boost::hs parallel to Boost.Bimap
and Boost.MRU.

Thanks to Google to put up such an amazing project as SoC is.

Finally, thanks to my family that have been there for me always.
