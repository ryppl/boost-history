[section Introduction]

With Boost.Bimap you can create associative containers where both types
can be used as key. You can think a `bimap<X,Y>` as a merge of
a `std::map<X,Y>` and a `std::map<Y,X>`.
The learning curve of bimap is almost zero if you know how to use standard containers.
A big effort was put in mapping the naming scheme of the STL in Boost.Bimap.
The library is designed to match the STL common containers.

[h2 How to use this document]

There is a lot of information in Boost.Bimap documentation. Although it may be
a very good idea to read it all, this documentation is intended for different
type of programmers.

[variablelist
[[I have to finished this today, I just want a bidirectional map!][
If your boss is going to kill you if the project is not finished by the end of the day, just
read the [link boost_bimap.one_minute_tutorial one minute tutorial]. If you
have an STL background I swear that you will be testing a bimap in less than
ten minutes.
]]
[[I am a serious programmer and want to learn Boost.Bimap][
Boost.Bimap has a lot to offer if you can spend some time reading this docs.
You have to read [link boost_bimap.the_tutorial The tutorial] and skim some
of the [link boost_bimap.examples Examples]. The best way to read this docs is in
order. Just press the ['next] arrow at the right bottom corner when you
finished each page. Stop when you reach the reference section, you may want
to read some specific part of it later to see a function signature or to look
for a specific metafunction.
]]
[[I just love C++, I want to see Boost.Bimap guts...][
If you are a library developer, these documents are the best place to learn
how Boost.Bimap is implemented. It is very recommendable that you first learn
to use the library as if you were the second type of programmer.
This library was developed in the Google SoC 2006, and the mentor and the
 student generate a lot of documents in the building process. The rationale
section is huge and you will find there a lot of information. There is a history
section for people that find it useful. Finally, in the reference, every entity of
the library is documented and you can even browse the source code from it.

[note
If while reading the docs you get obfuscated at some point, please send me an email
to ['matias {dot} capeletto {at} gmail {dot} com] telling me which type of programmer
you are and the section that needs to be better. Please use the following notation
for the title: ['\[boost\]\[bimap\] Your problem], it will help me to spot it easily.
I will try to use your advice to make this docs better. Thanks and Enjoy!

[important
If you find a bug or if you would like to see an additional feature to
the library please use boost standard ways to deal with this kind of issues and do
not e-mail me directly. Boost has a very good system to
[@http://www.boost.org/more/bugs.htm track bugs] and
[@http://www.boost.org/more/requesting_new_features.htm features requests].
Using it is the best way of getting this kind of thing done as soon as possible.
