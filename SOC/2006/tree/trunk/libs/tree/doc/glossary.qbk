[variablelist
[[Child] [
A given cursor's child is any cursor that is found in the range described by its
`begin()` and `end()` member functions.
]]

[[Cursor] [
Informally, a cursor is to a tree what an iterator is to a standard library container:
a kind of pointer abstraction that denotes a position within the tree and can be 
ereferenced or used to traverse the tree both horizontally and vertically.

For a more formal definition, see (TODO: link to concept).
]]

[[Descendant] [
A cursor's descendant is best defined recursively: It is
* either a given cursor's child,
* or a descendant of one of it's children.
]]

[[Multiway Tree] [
]]

[[Parent] [
Pretty obvious: the inverse of a child.
]]

[[Root] [
]]

[[Sortable] [
]]

[[Subtree] [
All descendants of a given cursor.
]]
