[section Introduction]

[caution This is not a Boost library (yet) but a work in progress that has not been reviewed 
by the Boost community!]

["Trees a pervasive in Computer Science and there are few programs that do not use a tree data-structure 
in some form or another. The C++ standard library, however, does not provide a low-level tree-container.]
--[@http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?Google_Summer_Of_Code_2006#TREE]

[section Abstract]

A well-known STL example, practically all known associative container ([multi_]{map|set}) implementations
use a [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree red-black tree] as underlying structure to take care
of the required sorting and searching. But binary search trees like red-black ones, however important, 
are not the only genre of tree one is likely to encounter: apart from B-trees, tries or ternary search 
tree that usually have similar purposes (i.e. to provide a structure for quick -- normally O(log n) -- 
data retrieval and storage), trees might just map a given external structure most naturally (e.g. file 
hierarchies or xml files).

[section Download]

This library's current state is only available via [@http://subversion.tigris.org/ svn] from the
Boost repository for Google Summer of Code 2006(tm) at
[@https://www.boost-consulting.com/svn/main/boost/soc/2006]. The source code can be 
browsed online at [@https://boost-consulting.com/trac/soc/browser/boost/soc/2006/tree]. \n
A [@http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?action=downloadfile&filename=tree-soc2006.zip&directory=Containers& snapshot]
 of the final GSoC 2006 state (kindly provided by René Rivera) can be found at the 
[@http://boost-consulting.com/vault/ Boost Vault].

[section Acknowledgements]

This library originated in [@http://code.google.com/soc/boost/appinfo.html?csaid=E17EA7C7C537C131 one]
out of [@http://code.google.com/soc/boost/about.html ten] [@http://www.boost.org/ Boost] projects 
sponsored by [@http://www.google.com Google] during their [@http://code.google.com/soc Summer of Code 2006]. 
It was mentored by [@http://www.boost.org/people/rene_rivera.htm René Rivera]. \n
Kudos to DHL for forwarding my second check from rainy Vienna airport, Austria (30 minutes ride from 
my place) on to Dubai, UAE, so it could catch some sun first.
