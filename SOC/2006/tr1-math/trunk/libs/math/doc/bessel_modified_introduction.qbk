[heading Notation]

['x], ['y] : real number

['n] : nonnegative integer

['z], ['_nu], ['_mu] : complex number

[heading Definition]

Modified Bessel functions are defined as the solutions to the ordinary
differential equation

[$equations/mbessel1.png]

The following equivalent definitions are also widely used

[$equations/mbessel2.png]

[$equations/mbessel3.png]

where ['[I _nu](z)] is called Modified Bessel function of the first kind
and ['[K _nu](z)] is called Modified Bessel function of the second kind.

[note The right hand side of ['[K _nu](z)] equation is replaced by its
limiting value if ['_nu] is an integer.]

[heading Numerical Algorithms]

All computations of modified Bessel functions are based on [link
mbessel_recur recurrence relations]. To use the recursion, initial
values must first be calculated. The methods differ for ['_nu] = ['n]
is integer and ['_nu] is any real number. We will discuss the two
situations separately.
