[section Queue Policy]

A [concept Queue Policy] is a type which is used as a handle to related
__pc_queue__ types. These [concept Queue Policys] generally act as policies to
higher-level templates which choose the appropriate __pc_queue__ based on the
knowledge of how the queue will be used. In =Boost.Act=, such types are used as
policies to __consumer_policy__ templates.

In order to be considered a valid [concept Queue Policy], given the
variable definitions below, the following expressions must be well-formed and
have the indicated effects.
