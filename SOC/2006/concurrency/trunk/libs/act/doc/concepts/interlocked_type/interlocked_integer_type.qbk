[section Interlocked Integer Type]

An [concept Interlocked Integer Type] is an __interlocked_arithmetic_type__
which supports common integer operations.

In order to be considered a valid [concept Interlocked Integer Type], given
the variable definitions below, the following expressions must be well-formed
and have the indicated effects, in addition to those requirements of
__interlocked_arithmetic_type__. [concept Interlocked Integer Types] also
support all operations specified in the C++ standard for integer types. Such
operations do not imply memory barriers of any kind.
