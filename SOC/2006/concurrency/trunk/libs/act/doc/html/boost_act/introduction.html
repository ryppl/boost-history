      With the advent of multi-core processors reaching the mainstream user along
      with the gradual tapering of the increase of individual core speeds, there
      is a growing need for high-level tools to simplify the creation of multi-threaded
      applications in order to allow for scalability of software over the years to
      come. Preferably, a solution should also allow existing code-bases to be easily
      and incrementally updated to take advantage of modern day processors, and as
      well, code which may be targetting both multi-core and single-core processors
      should not have to suffer by strictly using one model of execution. Rather,
      behavior should be toggleable on a variety of levels such that alterations
      in a small number of locations in code could change the technique used for
      execution over a large portion of a given project.
    </p>
            <p>
      Boost.Act attempts to supply a solution to this problem in the form of a portable
      library which provides STL-style algorithms that can be toggled via template
      policies to execute either synchronously or in parallel, and by providing templates
      and macros to allow the creation of asynchronous functions, active objects,
      and atomic objects. In addition, Boost.Act also allows the decoupling of signaling
      function calls from their actual invocations in such a way that one may switch
      between immediate, concurrent, lazy evaluation, or a user-provided evaluation
      strategy on a case-by-case basis with potentially no runtime cost to the application.

      In order to be able to construct the high-level concepts presented in this
      library and to allow users to be able to portably and efficiently implement
      their own shared-memory datastructures and algorithms, portable low-level interaction
      must be made both possible and efficient. In <code class="literal">Boost.Act</code>,
      this is accomplished through the use of the low-level abstraction of an <a href="interlocked/interlocked_concepts/interlocked_type.html" title="Interlocked Type"> <code class="literal">Interlocked
      Type</code></a>, which are types that support both thread-unsafe and
      thread-safe operations with semantics specified by the user at the call-site.

    </h4>
            <p>
      For the scope of this library, a polymorphic algorithm is considered to be
      an algorithm whose model of execution may vary depending on policies passed
      prior to invocation. For example, a polymorphic algorithm may run serially
      with one policy and may internally run in parallel and rejoin with a different
      policy. Regardless of which policies are used, the same logical operation is
      performed, allowing users to switch between different execution models with
      minimal changes to code.
    </p>
            <p>
      One of the fundamental components of Boost.Act is its collection of STL-style
      polymorphic algorithms. Those familiar with the STL will find themselves right
      at home, as the majority of the algorithms correspond directly with those in
      the STL and are callable in a similar manner, with the additional ability to
      toggle the execution model of the algorithm. Along with the standard algorithms
      provided by the STL, other templates are also included for the sole purpose
      of the creation of user-defined polymorphic algorithms.

      <a href="introduction.html#boost_act.introduction.algorithm_models">Algorithm Models</a>
    </h4>
            <p>
      By default, Boost.Act algorithms are performed in parallel whenever possible.
      Algorithm models are types which are used as policies to alter this behavior
      when required on both a global and call-by-call level. In addition to the parallel
      algorithm model, a serial algorithm model is provided which forces calls to
      be made in a single thread. Users may also create their own algorithm models
      if the desired behavior is not provided by either of those included with the
      library.

            <h4><a id="id388836"></a>
      <a href="introduction.html#boost_act.introduction.actions">Actions</a>
    </h4>
            <p>
      It is often desirable to be able to signal a function, perform other unrelated
      operations, and then eventually wait for the signaled function's completion.
      In order to provide such functionality, Boost.Act introduces the concept of
      an <code class="literal">action</code>, which is similar in many ways to a <code class="literal">future</code>.
    </p>
            <p>
      An <code class="literal">action</code> is a type which represents a signaled operation.
      With a stored <code class="literal">action</code>, you have access to that operation
      such that you may wait for the function's completion if you need the effects
      to have taken place prior to reaching a further point in code. Actions also
      provide an indirect interface to the result of a signaled function which allows
      you to queue operations that may act upon the result of the signalled function
      and which execute in the same thread as the original call.
    </p>
            <a id="boost_act.introduction.active_objects"></a>
            <h4><a id="id390117"></a>
      <a href="introduction.html#boost_act.introduction.active_objects">Active Objects</a>
    </h4>
            <p>
      Much like we have a way of decoupling the signaling of a function from the
      actual invocation of that function, Boost.Act also provides a way to separate
      the signaling of intrinsic functions of a type from the invocation of such
      functions, yet guarantees the same order of execution of such functions relative
      to one another. Since the invocations of such functions are serialized, it
      makes it easy to signal several functions which all deal with the same object
      without having to worry that one call may occur while another is executing,
      and with the guarantee that they are called in the same order as they were
      signaled.
