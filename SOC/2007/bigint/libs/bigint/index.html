<h2><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h2>

<p>Standard C++ without third-party libraries offers support for several integer
types, though all of them have limited range of values. This range is enough
for majority of applications, but in some cases, which include scientific and
cryptography-related applications, there is a need for so called "arbitrary
precision numbers" - those are the numbers which have precision limited only by
amount of available memory.</p>

<p>Note that due to the lack of hardware support for abitrary precision integers,
any operations that can be performed with them are slower than the corresponding
operations for native (C++ built-in) types; therefore they should not be treated
as a complete replacement for existing types, but rather as a possibility to trade
performance for precision.</p>

<p>There are several different third-party libraries available, they have different
performance/portability characteristics; this library provides a numeric type
<b>bigint</b>, strictly defines the set of operations that can be performed and their
behavior, provides a portable (albeit slow) implementation of said operations; and
also provides a implementation which uses the fastest available arbitrary precision
library, <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GNU MP</a>.</p>

<p>The library is intended to be highly extensible and encourages developers to create
their own implementation that would close the gap between 'portable' and 'gmp' implementations
in terms of performance; a set of correctness and performance tests is provided to
easen the development of such implementations.</p>

<h2><a name="Background">Background</a></h2>

<p>The <b>bigint</b> number class provides an implementation of integer concept. The representation
is always exact, and there are no overflows/underflows; all operations except division by zero,
evaluating remainder from the division by zero or evaluating square root of negative number are
perfectly defined, and give the value that does not depend on implementation. Everything except
the visible behavior - including in-memory representation, operations performance/memory complexity -
depends on the implementations. Implementation authors are encouraged to provide information about
memory requirements and performance complexities (the table for two existing implementations is
present in this documentation) to help the user of the library choose the implementation that will
suite his or her needs best of all.</p>

<p><b>bigint</b> class is designed so that it is compatible with the built-in integer types in the
largest extent possible; this means that all arithmetical and logical types available are available
for <b>bigint</b> class; <b>bigint</b> is implicitly constructible from integer types so that integer
types can be used where compiler is expecting <b>bigint</b> - both in operators and functions; some
of integer functions present in C++ standard are also redefined for <b>bigint</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="Interface">Interface</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Choosing_implementation">Choosing the implementation</a></h3>

<p>The bigint library consists of two distinct parts - the interface class <b>bigint_base</b>, and a set
of implementation classes. <b>bigint_base</b> is a templated class with a single template parameter - the
actual implementation. There is a convenience typedef, <b>bigint</b>, which equals to <b>bigint_base</b>,
parametrized by the most advanced implementation available. As library provides only two implementations
by default, <b>bigint</b> is equal to GMP-based implementation if the define BOOST_BIGINT_HAS_GMP_SUPPORT
is set in <i>boost_config.hpp</i> file; otherwise <b>bigint</b> uses the portable implementation.</p>

<p>In most cases users should just use <b>bigint</b>, but if they have a need to use the specific implementation,
they can use it like this:

<pre>
	#include "header_with_specific_implementation_class.hpp"

	typedef boost::bigint_base&lt;specific_implementation_class&gt; bigint_special;

	bigint_special a = 1, b = a * (a - 4);
</pre>

<font color="#ff0000">As this can change and bigint_base can be parametrized by both implementation and storage class
in future, this section has to be revised before the project ends</font>
</p>

<h3><a name="Constructors">Constructors</a></h3>

<p><b>bigint</b> class has three types of constructors: default constructor, constructors from built-in integer types, and
constructors from strings.</p>

<p>Default constructor initializes <b>bigint</b> class instance to zero; note that as <b>bigint</b> class is an implementation
of integer concept, there is no such distinction between positive and negative zero.</p>

<p>Integer constructors initialize <b>bigint</b> from build-in integer types; the result of constructor is that <b>bigint</b>
instance contains the exact representation of the passed value. Note that these constructors are <em>not</em> declared as explicit;
this means that you can freely use values of build-in integer types where you have to use <b>bigint</b>; for example, this is
correct:

<pre>
    int a = 10;
    boost::bigint b = 3;
    boost::bigint c = b + a;
    boost::bigint d = c / 49;
</pre>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>bigint</b> relies on the presence of 64-bit integer support, but this may change in the future</font>
</p>

<p>String constructors initialize <b>bigint</b> from string in the certain format. Strings can be wide, and you can pass either
a <b>std::string</b>/<b>std::wstring</b> or the pointer to the null-terminated character sequence. The accepted number format
is as follows:</p>

<pre>
[spaces][sign][digits]
</pre>

<p>'spaces' is a group of whitespace symbols (as detected by ::isspace/::iswspace CRT functions), there can be zero or more symbols
in it.</p>

<p>'sign' is either an empty string, '+' or '-' symbol. '+' sign is ignored, '-' sets the number to the negative one (string "-3" will
initialize <b>bigint</b> instance to -3, string "+3" will initialize it to 3).</p>

<p>'digits' is a group of digits belonging to the character set of the base that is passed to the constructor; base is a number
that is greater or equal to 2 and less or equal to 36; bases outside of allowed range lead to undefined results <font color="#ff0000">
perhaps we should change that and initialize number to 0 if base is &lt; 2 or &gt; 36?</font>. For bases less or equal than 10,
the character set of digits from 0 to (base-1) is used. For bases greater than 10, the character set consists of digits from 0
to 9, and then the letters from 'A' (ASCII character 'A') to the last needed letter for the set to reach the needed size. Letters are not case sensitive.
Letter 'A' corresponds to digit 10, letter 'B' corresponds to digit 11 and so on. Letter 'Z' (if applicable - this is an allowed
letter only for base = 36) corresponds to digit 35.</p>

<p>The group of digits is interpreted as a number that is written from the most significant digit to the least significant one;
there can be an arbitrary number of zero digits ('0') preceding the group.

<p>Examples:
<ul>
<li>For base 2, only characters '0' and '1' can be used. String "1100" in base 2 corresponds to the number 12 (decimal).</li>
<li>For base 10, any digit characters can be used. String "1234" in base 10 corresponds to the number 1234 (decimal).</li>
<li>For base 16, any digit characters can be used. Additionally characters 'A'-'F' and 'a'-'f' can be used. String "Ff4a" in base 16 corresponds to the number 65354 (decimal). Note that letter case is irrelevant.</li>
<li>For base 36, any digit characters can be used. Additionally characters 'A'-'Z' and 'a'-'z' can be used. String "ZZ" in base 36 corresponds to the number 1295 (decimal).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If the input string has characters that are not allowed in the input string, the first such character
and <em>all</em> consecutive characters (including allowed ones) are ignored.
If there are no digit characters before the first discarded characters, the number is initialized to 0 (for example,
passing "-A23" as an input string and 10 as base will initialize the number to 0, as it will ignore all characters
from 'A' onward, including 'A').</p>

<h3><a name="Arithmetic_operations">Arithmetic operations</a></h3>

<p>All of the standard numeric operators are defined for the <b>bigint</b> class. These include:</p>

<pre>
    +    +=
    -    -=
    *    *=
    /    /=
    %    %=
    ++   --    (both prefix and postfix)
    ==   !=
    &lt;    &gt;
    &lt;=   &gt;=
    + (unary)
    - (unary)
</pre>

<p>They have the same semantics as the standard ones.</p>

<p>Some things that have to be noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Division by zero (and taking remainder from the division by zero, i.e. i % 0) generates division by zero for the built-in
<b>int</b> type; therefore, division by zero results in undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Operations never produce an overflow/underflow and the result is perfectly accurate.</li>
<li>The result of +, +=, -, -=, *, *=, ++, --, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=, unary + and unary - operators is exactly the
same as the result of corresponding operations for the mathematical integer concept.</li>
<li>Division operation (/ and /=) results in so called truncated division; this means that if the dividend is not exactly
divisible by the divisor, the result is equal to the result of real number division which is later truncated to the integer
number which has the absolute value which is less than that of the real number quotient. Such truncation is also called rounding
towards zero. Here are some examples to clarify the concept:
    <ul>
    <li>60 / 15 == 4. 60 is exactly divisible by 15, no truncation takes place.</li>
    <li>-60 / 15 == -4. -60 is exactly divisible by 15, no truncation takes place.</li>
    <li>60 / -15 == -4. 60 is exactly divisible by -15, no truncation takes place.</li>
    <li>3 / 2 == 1. 3 is not exatly divisible by 2; the quotient of real number division is 1.5, it is truncated to 1.</li>
    <li>-3 / 2 == -1. -3 is not exatly divisible by 2; the quotient of real number division is -1.5, it is truncated to -1.</li>
    <li>3 / -2 == -1. 3 is not exatly divisible by -2; the quotient of real number division is -1.5, it is truncated to -1.</li>
    <li>-3 / -2 == 1. -3 is not exatly divisible by -2; the quotient of real number division is 1.5, it is truncated to 1.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Modulo operation (% and %=) is implemented in terms of truncated division; this means, that if a / b == c, then a % b == a - b * c. This means that:
	<ul>
	<li>Modulo by zero results in undefined behavior</li>
	<li>If a is exactly divisible by b, a % b == 0</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the sign of a % b is always equal to the sign of a.
	</ul>
Here are some examples to clarify the concept:
	<ul>
	<li>34 % 5 == 4. 34 / 5 == 6 (see above for the description of truncating division), 34 % 5 == 34 - (6 * 5) == 4.</li>
	<li>34 % -5 == 4. 34 / -5 == -6, 34 % -5 == 34 - (-6 * -5) == 4.</li>
	<li>-34 % 5 == -4. -34 / 5 == -6, -34 % 5 == -34 - (-6 * 5) == -4.</li>
	<li>-34 % -5 == -4. -34 / -5 == 6, -34 % -5 == -34 - (6 * -5) == -4.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Bitwise_operations">Bitwise operations</a></h3>

<p>All of the standard bitwise operators are defined for the <b>bigint</b> class. These include:</p>

<pre>
    &amp;    &amp;=
    |    |=
    ^    ^=
    ~ (unary)
    &lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;=
    &gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;=
</pre>

<p>These function operate with a bit representation of numbers. Note that though there are no strict requirements for
storage of <b>bigint</b> implementations, bitwise operators are guaranteed to operate with the following representation:
positive numbers are represented as a sequence of bits, most significant bit is first, least significant bit is last, the
sequence of bits is equal to the representation of the number in binary number system; zero is represented as a single bit 0;
negative numbers are represented as 2-complement of their absolute value (note that this means that negative number have an
infinite number of 1s at the beginning; for the purpose of bitwise operations we assume that positive numbers have an infinite
number of 0s at the beginning).</p>

<p>Given such representation, the result of each bit operation is defined as the number representation of a bit sequence, which
is constructed from two bit sequences of operands (to be precise, of two bit sequences, which are bit representation of the operands),
or of a bit sequence of a single operand in case of unary operator, by applying the bitwise operator to those sequences.</p>

<p>Examples to clarify the concept:
<ul>
<li>3 & 6 == 11b & 110b == 10b == 2</li>
<li>3 | 6 == 11b | 110b == 111b == 7</li>
<li>3 ^ 6 == 11b ^ 110b == 101b == 5</li>
<li>-3 & 6 == -(11b) & 110b == 1....1101b & 0....0110b == 0....0100b == 100b == 4</li>
<li>-3 | 6 == -(11b) & 110b == 1....1101b | 0....0110b == 1....1111b == -(1b) == -1</li>
<li>-3 ^ 6 == -(11b) & 110b == 1....1101b ^ 0....0110b == 1....1011b == -(101b) == -5</li>
<li>~(-3) == ~(-(11b)) == ~1....1101b == 0....0010b == 2</li>
<li>-3 << 2 == -(11b) << 2 == 1....1101b << 2 == 1....110100b == -(1100b) == -12</li>
<li>-3 >> 2 == -(11b) >> 2 == 1....1101b >> 2 == 1....11b == -(1b) == -1</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that shift operators can't shift more than for 2^64 digits; this is beyond the limit of memory anyway (2^64 bits means
2^61 bytes for storage, which is equal to 2^31 Gb of data) and is not going to change.</p>

<h3><a name="Input_and_Output">Input and Output</a></h3>

<p>Input and output operators <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
are provided. They meet all flags and locale requirements (that is, you
can use <code>showpos, oct, hex</code> and other flags, decimal separators
are also supported. Input operator stops at the first unrecognized character.
In short, input and output operators behave exactly as you would expect them to
behave for build-in integer types.</p>

<h3><a name="Conversions">Conversions</a></h3>

<p>There is a conversion operator to an unspecified Boolean type (most likely a
member pointer). This operator converts a <b>bigint</b> to <code>false</code> if it
represents zero, and <code>true</code> otherwise. This conversion allows a
rational for use as the first argument of operator <code>?:</code>; as either
argument of operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> without
forfeiting short-circuit evaluation; as a condition for a <code>do</code>,
<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>for</code> statement; and as a
conditional declaration for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, or
<code>for</code> statements. The nature of the type used, and that any names
for that nature are kept private, should prevent any inappropriate non-boolean
use like numeric or pointer operations or as a <code>switch</code> condition.</p>

<p>Note: the provided <code>operator!</code> is not strictly necessary from the point of C++ standard,
and is a workaround for some compilers.</p>

<p><b>bigint</b> values can be converted to strings of arbitrary base (provided it
meets the conditions 2 &lt;= base &lt;= 36). The output string consists of sign
(a symbol '-' present only if the value is negative) and of a sequence of characters
that represent digits. This sequence consists of the same characters that can
occur in the string passed to the string constructors of bigint; the description
of the values and their meaning can be seen in the <a href="#Constructors">Constructors</a>
section. No unnecessary zeroes or whitespace characters are added to the output string
(if the value is equal to 0, the string "0" is returned); all letter symbols are
lowercase. Generally, the following always holds true:

<pre>
	bigint(value.str()) == value
</pre>
</p>

<p>While <b>bigint</b> provides storage and operations for numbers of arbitrary precision,
sometimes the stored values fit into C++ built-in integer types, and sometimes there's a need
to convert from <b>bigint</b> to one of those types. You can check whether such conversion is
possible via <code>can_convert_to</code> function, and convert <b>bigint</b> to a value of built-in
integer type via <code>to_number</code> function. Note that if <code>value.can_convert_to<T>()</code>
is <code>false</code>, the result of <code>value.convert_to<T>()</code> is undefined. If <code>value.can_convert_to<T>()</code>
is <code>true</code>, the following always holds true:

<pre>
	bigint(value.convert_to<T>()) == value
</pre>

These functions work only for types which have traits in <code>std::numeric_limits</code>, and do not have to work for types
which are longer than 64 bit even if such types are natively supported.</p>

<h3><a name="Other_functions">Other functions</a></h3>

<p><code>abs</code> function returns an absolute value of passed parameter.</p>

<p><code>pow</code> function returns the passed parameter raised to the specified power. Negative powers are naturally not supported. pow(0, 0) == 1.</p>

<p><code>div</code> function returns both quotient and remainder for the division. The division is a truncated one; for further reference, see section <a href="#Arithmetic_operations">Arithmetic operations</a>.
This function is similar to standard <code>div</code> function for integers.</p>

<p><code>sqrt</code> function computes a square root of the passed parameter. Passing a negative value to <code>sqrt</code> results in undefined behavior.</p>

<h3><a name="Serialization">Serialization</a></h3>

<p><b>bigint</b> has built-in support for serialization via Boost.Serialization library. You need to include a separate header,
&lt;boost/bigint/bigint_serialize.hpp&gt;, then you can use <b>bigint</b> values. The storage format is the decimal string
representation, though this is an implementation detail and may change in future.</p>

<h2><a name="Performance">Performance</a></h2>

<p>While different <b>bigint</b> implementations have different performance characteristics, developers are encouraged to
provide a table with summary performance of implemented methods. Such table for existing implementations exists here.
N means the length of the value itself (applicable only for methods), A1, A2, etc. mean length of the function
arguments, and M means maximum of the lengths of both value and function arguments (M = max(N, A1, A2, ...)).</p>

<p>'Length' means number of bits for integer arguments and number of characters for strings.</p>

<p>Most implementations of <b>bigint</b> allocate memory for various uses (both temporary
memory and memory for value storage); therefore any <b>bigint</b> function (except <b>bigint</b>
destructor) may throw a <code>std::bad_alloc</code> exceptions. There are no other possible
exceptions.</p>

<p>The library was implemented by me (Arseny Kapoulkine) as a Boost project for
Google Summer of Code.</p>

<p>Jeff Garland helped with different design and implementation-related things
during the project.</p>

<p>Jarrad Waterloo reminded me of some issues in the initial design that were
overlooked (64-bit integer support, various bases for string conversion</p>

<p>Phil Endecott reminded me to take special care of negative numbers in implementation
and documentation of bitwise operators.</p>

<p>I shamelessly stole small parts of Boost.Rational documentation (and based
the whole structure of this file on it), which was written by Paul Moore and
Daryle Walker.</p>
