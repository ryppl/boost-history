[section PortCategory]

A [PortCategory] designates a category of [Port] in the Dataflow library.
The library currently defines two [PortCategory]s:

* `boost::dataflow::ports::producer`, and
* `boost::dataflow::ports::consumer`.

[heading Notation]
The following expressions are used in this document:

            is possible to make connections between [Port]s of

            [PortCategory] `PC::complement`.

[section:complementedport ComplementedPort, ComplementedPortTraits]

A ComplementedPort `P` is a [Port] s.t. whenever it is
[BinaryOperable] with another [Port] `P2`, `P2` is
a particular type - either `P`'s complement type, or a [KeyedPort]
that delegates to `P`'s complement type in a binary operation with `P`.

[ComplementedPort]s are useful in situations where [Port] types
are [BinaryOperable] in a one-to-one fashion (a pair of [Port] types
are each other's port complements), or in a one-to-many fashion (a number
of [Port] types have the same complement port).  An example of the
latter is [DataflowSignals], where any `signal` of signature `T` has
a complement port of type `function<T>`, and can therefore model
[ComplementedPort], but `function<T>` cannot because there are many `signal`
types to which it can be connected.

The traits of a [ComplementedPort] are captured by the
[ComplementedPortTraits], which refines the [PortTraits] with
an additional member type specifying the complement port type.

sub-[Port]s.

[section:keyedport KeyedPort, KeyedPortTraits]

A [KeyedPort] type `KP` is a [VectorPort] whose sub-[Port]s are accessible
by key.  Whenever a binary operation is performed between a [Port] of type `P`
and `KP`, it is forwarded to the binary operation between `P` and the 
sub-[Port] in `KP` keyed by the [PortTraits] of `P`.
