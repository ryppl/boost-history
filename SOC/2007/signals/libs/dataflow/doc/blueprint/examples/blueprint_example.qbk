[section:blueprint Run-time reflection and connectivity modeling using Dataflow.Blueprint]

The (recently started) [DataflowBlueprint] layer offers run-time reflection
of components and modeling of
a dataflow network through a BGL graph.  Here is the output of a small example
which briefly illustrates some of the capabilities:


[pre
Printing runtime info about all of the components:

	source has 4 ports. 
		port 0 is a signals connection producer
		port 1 is a signals connection consumer
		port 2 is a signals extraction producer
		port 3 is a signals extraction consumer

	sink has 4 ports. 
		port 0 is a signals connection producer
		port 1 is a signals connection consumer
		port 2 is a signals extraction producer
		port 3 is a signals extraction consumer

	source_float has 4 ports. 
		port 0 is a signals connection producer
		port 1 is a signals connection consumer
		port 2 is a signals extraction producer
		port 3 is a signals extraction consumer

	sink_float has 4 ports. 
		port 0 is a signals connection producer
		port 1 is a signals connection consumer
		port 2 is a signals extraction producer
		port 3 is a signals extraction consumer


Printing some runtime port connectability info:

source port 0 is connectable to sink port 1
source port 1 is not connectable to sink port 0
source port 0 is not connectable to sink port 0
source port 0 is not connectable to sink_float port 1

Making blueprint connections: source to sink, source_float to sink_float...

Using BGL to analyze the network... BGL says there are 2 independent parts of the network!

Making a copy of the blueprint.

Testing the original network...

	Values at components:
		value at source:100
		value at sink:0
		value at source_float:100.1
		value at sink_float:0

	Connecting the underlying components in the network...
	Invoking the sources...

	Values at components:
		value at source:100

		value at source_float:100.1
		value at sink_float:100.1

Testing the network copy...

	Values at components:
