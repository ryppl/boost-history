[section:blueprint Run-time reflection and connectivity modeling using Dataflow.Blueprint]

The (recently started) [DataflowBlueprint] layer offers run-time reflection
of components and modeling of
a dataflow network through a BGL graph.  The following example briefly
illustrates some of the capabilities:

[blueprint_example]

The output is:

[pre
source has 2 ports. 
  port 0 is a producer
  port 1 is a consumer

source port 0 is connectable to sink port 1
source port 1 is not connectable to sink port 0
source port 0 is not connectable to sink port 0
source port 0 is not connectable to sink_float port 1

Blueprint connecting source to sink, source_float to sink_float...

Using BGL to analyze the network... There are 2 independent parts of the network.

Making the connections...
Invoking the sources...
sink now has:100
sink_float now has:100.1
