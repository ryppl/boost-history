[section producer_group]

[heading Model of]
* [ProducerPortConcept]

[heading Description]

A [producer_group] collects multiple producers in a group, so that they
can be connected all together to a [consumer_group].  The connections
are made element-wise, i.e, the first producer in the [producer_group] is
connected to the first consumer in the [consumer_group], the second
producer to the second consumer, etc. [producer_group]
is a wrapper for [BoostFusion] sequences which allows them to be
used in this fashion.

Examples of connections between [producer_group] and [consumer_group] objects,
as well as grouping components together using `operator&` can be seen
in the [DataflowPhoenix] documentation.

are made element-wise, i.e, the first producer in the [producer_group] is
connected to the first consumer in the [consumer_group], the second
producer to the second consumer, etc. [consumer_group]

[section consumer_map]

A [consumer_map] groups together multiple consumers, keyed by type they consume.
When a [ProducerPortConcept] is connected to a [consumer_map], the consumer
whose key matches the [ProducerPortConcept]'s produced type will be chosen for
the connection.
[consumer_map] is a wrapper for [BoostFusion] maps which allows them to be
used in this fashion.


A [consumer_map] is used as the return type of [^[storage].send_slot()],
which and includes the [slot_selector] for both the fused and unfused
versions of the `send()` function.  The appropriate slot is selected when
a connection is made, based on the [ProducerPortConcept]'s outgoing signal
signature.
