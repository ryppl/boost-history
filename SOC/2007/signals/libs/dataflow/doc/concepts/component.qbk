[section:component Component, ComponentTraits]

A ['[ComponentConcept]] is the fundamental data processing element.  It can
have a number of [PortConcept]s, and can also be [InvocableConcept].

The traits of a component are held in a ['[ComponentTraitsConcept]] type.
There are multiple ways of registering the [ComponentTraitsConcept]
for a [ComponentConcept] (see examples below).

    [[C] [A [ComponentConcept] type.]]
    [[CT] [The [ComponentTraitsConcept] type of `C`.]]
    [[I] [An MPL Integral Constant in the range \[0, n of ports exposed by C).]]
    [[c] [An object of type C.]]

[section:componentoperable ComponentOperable (Invocable) ]

A [ComponentConcept] `P` is /ComponentOperable/
for a component operation `O`, and mechanism `M`, if the implementation of
the component operation `O` has been specialized for `M` and `P`

In this case,

* If `O` is operations::invoke, `P` is [InvocableConcept]

[heading Notation]
The following expressions are used in this document:

[variablelist
    [[C] [A [ComponentConcept] type.]]
    [[c] [An object of type P.]]

            input data and produce its output data as appropriate.
