Dataflow is a generic library for [WikiDataflow] programming using various data
transport mechanisms.  The Dataflow library
comes with support for two data transport mechanisms - one is based on
[BoostSignals], and the other (experimental) is based connections made through
simple object pointers, with support for using [BoostPhoenix2]
actors for data processing.

The two data transport mechanisms are implemented in the [DataflowSignals]
and [DataflowPhoenix] modules.  The idea behind providing a generic dataflow
library is that other data transport mechanisms can be easily adapted for
use with the library.

[warning Dataflow is not a part of the Boost libraries.  It is being developed
as a part of the Google Summer of Code program.  The original proposal (for
the Signal Network library, which became the Dataflow library)
as well as some status updates can be found on the
[@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/soc/2007/SignalNetwork GSoC page].]

* If you would like some more information about why one would want to connect
  objects into a signal-based network, read about
  [link dataflow.introduction.dataflow Dataflow programming in C++].
* If you'd like to try out the library
    * keep in mind that the interface is highly unstable at this point
    * see the [signals_quickstart] section of [DataflowSignals].

[section:discussion Discussion on Boost Community Feedback]

The following summarizes some of the suggestions / comments given by the Boost community, and
what has been done to incorporate this feedback.

[* Tobias Schwinger indicated that the library could be used for pulling rather than pushing data.]

* [link dataflow.connections.pull An example] which illustrates this has been addded.

[* James Jones suggested that a ||-like operator could be used for branching, and >> for chaining.]

* `operator >=` which was orignally used for branching has been replaced with `operator |`.
* Since the most straightforward way for me to implement chaining/branching is using a left-to-right
operator for one and a right-to-left operator for the other, I decided to stay with >>= as the chaining
operator.

[* Paolo Coletta suggested a "video_generator >>= ( effect1 && effect2 ) >>= image_sum" - like syntax that
  would allow parallel processing of signals (identified as the "join" pattern by Yigong Liu)]

* I have started to implement thread-related components in [timed_generator] and [mutex].
More sophisticated threading components, control and syntax to follow.

[* Yigong Liu suggested enhanced support for common network topologies, such as mesh. ]

* I have implemented a prototype
[chain] topology
to get a start on this concept.

[* Braddock Gaskill pointed out the relationship with the "pipes and filters" pattern, and suggested
   the possibility of using functions as filters.  He also suggested the library would me more useful
   if different functions executed in parallel threads, or were queued to specific worker threads,
   if the library would provide functionality to control and schedule the execution of the invoked functions,
   or traverse the call graph.]

* In light of the possible connection with the "pipes and filters" pattern, the base
  object for signal network components which receive a signal and send a signal has
  been changed to [filter].
  I was not successful in finding a formal definition
  of what "pipes and filters" semantics should be, so I am not sure whether this is appropriate.
* [function]
  now offers the proposed functionality of converting functions into filters.
* Threading and scheduling of the invoked functions is something I plan to address.
* Providing a call graph would be a great feature, but I am not sure what the best
  way to address that is, since each component might be of a different type.  Perhaps a graph
  in which only the edges are labeled (with connection objects) would be doable and useful.

[section:download Download and Changelog]

Please keep in mind that this code is a prototype and far from the finished product.  I am learning
as I go, and any feedback on improving the implementation is very welcome.

GSoC Development version (*latest*) \[located in the Boost sandbox /SOC/2007/signals\]

* converting documentation to boostbook, using Boost.Build

Proposal for Boost / Google SoC version  \[[@signal_network.zip download]\]

* finished the signals::socket_sender and signals::socket_receiver components

Draft proposal for Boost / Google SoC version

* changed the file and namespace structure
* implemented a file-iteration based mechanism for arity-dependent classes
* changed the operators used
* signal_link is now signals::filter and does not need to know it's descendant's type
* implemented signals::junction, signals::selector, signals::storage, signals::timed_generator,
  signals::mutex, signals::chain, signals::function classes
