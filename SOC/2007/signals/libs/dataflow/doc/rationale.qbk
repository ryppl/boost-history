[heading Naming conventions]

* I encountered the term /dataflow/ after starting this library.  Although
  the information I can find about dataflow as
  a programming paradigm seems to be a little sub-par,
  it seems like the right name for this programming paradigm.
  As a part of developing this library and doing the accompanying research I
  can work on improving the information that is out there (on Wikipedia, etc.)
* I chose /component/ to refer to a processing element of a dataflow network,
  because the term has no prior (to my knowledge) C++ meaning.
* In differentiating components that output data from those that input data,
  I originally thought about using "input component"
  and "output component".  However, I realized that "input" and "output"
  switch depending on perspective - from the perspective
  of a component, it is "output" if it outputs data, but from the perspective
  of a corresponding connection, that same component is the
  "input".  A better choice might be /producer/ and /consumer/ as they don't
  suffer from the same problem.  Perhaps "provider"
  would be more accurate, and there is a precedent for this nomenclature.
