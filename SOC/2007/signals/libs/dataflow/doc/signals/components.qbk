[heading Description]

The [filter] class is provided as a base class for in / out components.
It provides support for Dataflow connection operators and functions,
and provides a default output signal.  Here is an example of a simple class
which inherits [filter]:

[test_filter_classes]

The type of the output signal (in the above example, `unfused_out_signal`)
is specified as the second template parameter.
There are three options:

* `unfused_out_signal` provides an unfused output signal named `out`.
* `fused_out_signal` provides a fused output signal named `fused_out`.
* `combined_out_signal` provides an unfused output signal named `out`,
  and a fused adapter for the signal named `fused_out`.
  This is useful for components which wish to use fusion internally but output
  an unfused signal.

A component developed on top of the [filter] class can then be used in the
appropriate network.  Here is an example which uses the class defined above:

[table filter-based class use example
    [[fused][unfused]]
    [[[test_filter_fused]][[test_filter_unfused]]]

[heading Description]

The [applicator] class applies a specified function object to a member variable
of a specified type whenever it receives a signal.
The signal is always forwarded.

* [counter]

[endsect][/applicator]

[section:conditional conditional]
[*See also]: [classref boost::signals::conditional conditional class reference.]

The [conditional] class applies a specified function object to a member variable
of a specified type whenever it receives a signal.
The signal is forwarded if the function object returns true.

Examples of conditionals:

* [junction]

  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [instantiator] class instantiates a specified type from a member variable
of a specified type whenever it receives a signal.
The signal is always forwarded.

Examples of applicators:

* [mutex]

  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [modifier] class instantiates a member function object of specified
type Member. It applies the member function object
to each incoming signal, and sends the returned value.

Examples of modifiers:

* [function]

[section:storage storage]
[*See also]: [classref boost::signals::storage storage class reference.]

[heading Model of]
* [SignalConsumerConcept]
* [SignalProducerConcept]
* [ConnectableConcept] to any [SignalProducerConcept] type `P` where 
  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [storage] class can store the arguments it receives from a signal,
as well as transmit the stored argument values through its own signal.

[table storage class use example
    [[fused][unfused]]
    [[[test_storage_fused]][[test_storage_unfused]]]
]
[endsect][/storage]

[section:counter counter]
[*See also]: [classref boost::signals::counter counter class reference.]

The [counter] class counts the number of passing signals.  Each time it
receives a signal, it will increment an internal
counter and forward the signal.

[table counter class use example
    [[fused][unfused]]
    [[[test_counter_fused]][[test_counter_unfused]]]
]

[endsect][/counter]

[heading Model of]
* [SignalConsumerConcept]
* [SignalProducerConcept]
* [ConnectableConcept] to any [SignalProducerConcept] type `P` where 
  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [junction] class can be used to bring in multiple signals, and forward
them all to the same set of output signals.

[table storage class use example
    [[fused][unfused]]
    [[[test_junction_fused]][[test_junction_unfused]]]
]
[endsect][/junction]

* [ConnectableConcept] to any [SignalProducerConcept] type `P` where 
  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [mutex] class locks an internal mutex when it receives a signal, and then forwards the signal.
[mutex] is an __instantiator__ with the Instantiation boost::mutex::scoped_lock and Member boost::mutex.

    [[fused][unfused]]
    [[[test_mutex_fused]][[test_mutex_unfused]]]

  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [function] class can be used to apply a function to an incoming signal and output the result.
[function] is a __modifier__ with the Modifier set to an adapter for the provided function.

[table function class use example
    [[fused][unfused]]
    [[[test_function_fused]][[test_function_unfused]]]

  `Signature` matches `P`'s produced type.
  
[heading Description]

The [socket_sender] class can be used to bridge a signal network accross multiple computers via a
network connection.  Any signal going to the [socket_sender] will be serialized and sent over a provided
socket.  A [socket_receiver] can be used on the other end to unserialize the signal and forward it.

Example:

[test_socket]
