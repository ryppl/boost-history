[section:connect connect function]

[*See also]: [funcref boost::signals::connect connect function reference.]

[DataflowSignals] provides a [connect] function in the `boost::signals`
namespace, which connects a [SignalProducer] and [SignalConsumer]
which are [Connectable].  

Given a [SignalProducer] `p` and [Connectable] [SignalConsumer] `c`,

    signals::connect(p,c);
    
will create a connection between the two.

The same function can also connect [components] which provide default ports.
With [DataflowSignals] [components], the default [SignalProducer] is the
[boost_signal] provided by each of the [components], and the default [SignalConsumer]
is the call operator ([^operator()]).

[note The call operator ([^operator()]) acts as a [KeyedPort] - an appropriate overload will
be selected depending on the signature of the signal being connected]

The [link dataflow.signals.introduction.quick_start quick start] section
has some examples.

[section:operators connection operators]

The examples in this documentation typically
use [operators] to create connections.  The [operators] use the [connect] function
directly, and can be replaced by invocations of [connect] if preferred.

[heading Chaining]

Chaining of components can be done using `operator >>=`.

[heading Branching]

More complex connections can also be made relatively easily using
both `operator >>=`
and `operator |`, with `operator |` being used for branching.

[section invoke function]

[DataflowSignals] provides an [invoke] function in the `boost::signals`
namespace, which invokes a [Invocable] [DataflowSignals]
[Component].

The only [Invocable] [component] provided by the library is [storage].

Here is an example that uses [invoke]:

[section:disconnect_all disconnect_all function]

The [disconnect_all] function can be used to disconnect all [SignalConsumer]s
from a [SignalProducer] (or from the default [SignalProducer] of a [component]).

Here is an example:
