[section:distributed Implementing distributed dataflow applications using
    Dataflow.Signals and Boost.Asio]

This example shows how you can take advantage of dataflow programming
to create distributed applications.  It works as long as the data
passed in the signal is serializable using [BoostSerialization].

[DataflowSignals] provides two components
which can be used to create a producer-consumer connection between two
computers: [socket_sender] and [socket_receiver].  As long as we have
a network socket set up between two computers, we can do the following to
set up a connection between a [SignalProducer] on one computer with a
[SignalConsumer] on another:

* On the [SignalProducer]'s computer, construct a [socket_sender] of
the appropriate `Signature` with the given socket.
[connect] the [SignalProducer] to the [socket_sender].
* On the [SignalConsumer]'s computer, construct a [socket_receiver] of
the appropriate `Signature` with the given socket.
[connect] the [socket_receiver] to the [SignalConsumer].

That's it.  Now, every signal sent out of the [SignalProducer] should
be received by the [SignalConsumer].

The following is a modification of the example from the
[link dataflow.introduction.dataflow motivation section] to a dataflow
network that straddles a network socket:
