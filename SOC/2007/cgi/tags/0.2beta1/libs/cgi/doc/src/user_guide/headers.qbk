[section:headers Choosing the correct headers]

Depending on what protocol you plan on using, you should include one of the following headers:

``
#include <boost/cgi.hpp>      // include header files for any protocol

#include <boost/cgi/cgi.hpp>  // include all headers required for (sync) CGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/acgi.hpp> // include all headers required for aCGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/fcgi.hpp> // include all headers required for FastCGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/scgi.hpp> // include all headers required for SCGI usage
``
