Development has moved to cgi.sf.net for now (on the cgi/branches directory):

  http://cgi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cgi/

'Stable' updates will be uploaded to here, as and when available.

Pre-built docs can be found at http://cgi.sf.net

Comments/critique are welcome and can be directed to one of:

  cgi-devel @ cgi dot sourceforge dot net
  lists dot drrngrvy @ gmail dot com

You can expect SCGI and FastCGI support this side of Chrismas!
