 * Notes:

 * 1. A FastCGI server doesn't have to use tcp sockets: it can use pipes

 *
 * 2. For now each request object could hold a pointer/reference to the
 * connection that it's associated with. For the forseable future that's going
 * to be enough. However, since the FastCGI spec doesn't say otherwise,
 * eventually it could happen that the response can be sent back via ANY open
 * connection. In that case, the request would have to query the gateway to
 * find an available connection before sending through it. For now, that's
 * unneccesary.
