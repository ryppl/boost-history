[section:headers Choosing the correct headers]

Depending on what protocol you plan on using, you should include [*one] of the following headers:

``
#include <boost/cgi.hpp> // include header files for any protocol

#include <boost/cgi/cgi.hpp> // include all headers required for (sync) CGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/acgi.hpp> // include all headers required for aCGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/fcgi.hpp> // include all headers required for FastCGI usage

#include <boost/cgi/scgi.hpp> // include all headers required for SCGI usage
``

Including <boost/cgi.hpp> [*and] defining one of the `BOOST_CGI_IMPLICIT_*` macros is equivalent to including one of the protocol-specific headers. As such, the shortcuts `cgi::request`, `cgi::acceptor` and `cgi::service` become `typedef`s for that protocol's more explicit types.

For example:
``
#define BOOST_CGI_IMPLICIT_SCGI 1
#include <boost/cgi.hpp>
cgi::request req;
``
Is equivalent to:
``
#include <boost/cgi/scgi.hpp>
cgi::request req;
``
Which is equivalent to:
``
#include <boost/cgi.hpp> // or <boost/cgi/scgi.hpp>, here
cgi::scgi_request req;
``
But:
``
#include <boost/cgi.hpp>
cgi::request req; // error
``
