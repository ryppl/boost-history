[important
This manual does [*not] document a library that is a part of __Boost__. The major part of it has been developed this summer as part of the Google Summer of Code, '[@http://code.google.com/soc GSoC07]'. Everything from here on in is alpha-grade, some bits more than others; [link boost.cgi.preface.comments_and_support comments] are welcome.

These documents are either hosted at [@http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgi/ sourceforge], or at [@http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/browser/sandbox/SOC/2007/cgi svn.boost.org]. For free!

[section:gs Getting Started]

This section of the documentation is probably best read before the [link __tutorial__ tutorial]. In a nutshell, this is a quick and dirty run-through of how to get and install the library [-and configure your server].
