[section Acknowledgements]

We owe many debts of thanks to a number of individuals who both inspired and encouraged us in
developing the Boost Graph Library. 

A most profound thanks goes to Alexander Stepanov for his pioneering work in generic programming,
for his encouragement, and for his algorithm contributions to the BGL. We thank Matthew Austern for
his work on documenting the concepts of STL which provided a foundation for creating the concepts in
the BGL. We thank Dietmar Kuhl for his work on generic graph algorithms and design patterns;
especially for the property map abstraction.

Dave Abrahams, Jens Maurer, Beman Dawes, Gary Powell, Greg Colvin, Valentin Bonnard, and the rest
of the group at Boost provided valuable input to the BGL interface, numerous suggestions for improvement,
proof reads of the documentation, and help with polishing the code. A special thanks to Dave Abrahams
for managing the formal review. 

We also thank the following BGL users whose questions helped to improve the BGL: Gordon Woodhull,
Dave Longhorn, Joel Phillips, and Edward Luke. 

A special thanks to Jeffrey Squyres for editing and proof reading of the documentation. 

Our original work on the Boost Graph Library was supported in part by NSF grant ACI-9982205 and by
the Director, Office of Science, Division of Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences of
the U.S. Department of Energy under contract number DE-AC03-76SF00098. 

In our work we also used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, which
is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy.
