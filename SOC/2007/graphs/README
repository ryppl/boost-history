Various Notes to Self

== Models of Concepts ==
I didn't know this - or at least I hadn't thought about it, but it appears that
undirected graphs model the BidirectionalGraph concept - at least they do with
adjacency_list. Curious...

== Nicities ==
Apparently, that migrating into a new namespace isn't going to work too well
since all the other algorithms are expecting functions in a particular namespace
and (probably more importantly) with a particular signature.

I think it would probably take a complete rewrite of Boost.Graph in order to
successfully create the more familiar interfaces.
