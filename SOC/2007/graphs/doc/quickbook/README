Just something to occupy the time when I don't feel like coding, I'm porting the 
Boost.Graph documentation to quickbook.

== Building ==

This probably won't build in its current location - you have to relocate the entire
quickbook directory to the Boost.Graph's documentation directory. So for me, I'd do this

cd $PATH_TO_SOC07_GRAPHS/doc
mv quickbook $PATH_TO_BOOST/libs/graph/doc
cd $PATH_TO_BOOST/libs/doc
bjam --v2

Of course, you'll need a functional build of quickbook and boostbook for it to
work.

It ain't pretty, but hopefully it'll be better by the end of the summer. See the
TODO file for the list of things that need to happen with it.
