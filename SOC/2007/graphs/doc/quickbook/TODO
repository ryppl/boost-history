- Obviously, finish copying over the rest of the documentation (there's lots of it...)
- Fix the introduction page so that it's more of a brief preface than a complete intro.
  The intro should be its own nested chapter - we might even want to incorporate the
  history, publications, and usage pages into a sort of "social" chapter.
- Make the "quick tour" a real user's guide a la xpressive or spririt. The one thing
  that definitely needs to be updated is discussion of properties in the guide. It
  might be nice to have the user's guide introduce topics based on various problems.
  Obviously, different problems require different types of graphs and different
  algorithms... 
- Is it feasible to reference code in examples in the user's guide or should it all
  be hand-written (and untested)?
- Can we make Better images? Can we center images in quickbook? (maybe using tables).
- Replace all occurences of "the BGL" with Boost.Graph to help harmonize with
  the "how to reference page".
- Get the build to generate xml documents and build a reference manual.
