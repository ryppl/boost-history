the order of data values is not important.

/*`A few (member) functions that set are fairly self-explanatory:

* title provides a title at the top for the whole plot,
* `legend_on(true)` will mean that titles of data series and markers will display in the legend box.
* `x_range(-1, 11)` sets the axis limits from -1 to +11 (instead of the default -10 to +10).
* `background_border_color(blue)` sets just one of the very many options.

/*`The syntax `my_plot.title("Hello").legend_on(true)...` may appear unfamiliar,
but is a convenient way of specifying many parameters in any order. It is equivalent to:
``
  my_plot.title("Race Times");
  my_plot.legend_on(true);
  my_plot.x_range(-1, 11);
  my_plot.background_border_color(blue);
``
Chaining thus allows you to avoid repeatedly typing "`myplot.`"
and easily group related settings like plot window, axes ... together.
A fixed order would clearly become impracticable with
hundreds of possible arguments needed to set all the myriad plot options.

Within all of the plot classes, 'chaining' works the same way,
by returning a reference to the calling object thus `return  *this;`

Then we need to add our data series,
and add optional (but very helpful) data series titles
if we want them to show on the legend.
