Let's examine what this does. 

  svg_2d_plot my_plot;

This constructor initializes a new 2D plot. This also sets the many default values. 

  my_plot.title("Race Times")
         .legend_on(true)
         .x_range(-1, 11)
         .background_border_color(black);

All of the setter methods are fairly self-explanatory. To walk through it once, 

* The title, which will appear at the top of the graph, will say "Race Times". 
* `legend_on(true)` means that the legend will show up. 
* `x_range(-1, 11)` means that the axis displayed will be between -1 and 11,
as you can see in the above images.
* `background_border_color(black)` sets the border around the image to `black`.
Ordinarily it is left to be the color of the background
(and so no border of plot area will be visible).
  
  my_plot.plot(map1, "Series 1", blue);
  my_plot.plot(map2, "Series 2", orange);

This draws `map1` and `map2` to `my_plot`. As many containers as you want can 
be drawn to `my_plot`. Evntually the plot will become cluttered and confusing,
when I recommend just creating another plot!

The name of the series is `"Race times"`, and that 
text will show in the legend. These are the two required parameters for
this function call. There are many optional parameters, as seen in the section 
[@plot_function Getting More Out of the `plot()` Function]

  my_plot.write("simple_2d.svg");

This writes plot `my_plot` to the file "simple_2d.svg".
