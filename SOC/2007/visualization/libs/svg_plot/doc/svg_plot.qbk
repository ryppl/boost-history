[section:preface Preface]

[heading Preface]
Humans have a fantastic capacity for visual understanding, and merely looking
at data organized in one, two, or three dimensions allows us to see relations
not otherwise visible in a list of numbers. Computers, however, deal with
information numerically, and C++ and the
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library Standard Template Library (STL)]
do not currently offer an easy way to bridge the gap.

This library aims to help the user to easily plot data that is stored in STL containers.

This project is focused on using STL containers in order to display data on a
one-dimensional, two-dimensional plot and boxplots.
The plot is written to a
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics Scalable Vector Graphic image]
(that can also be converted to other graph types,
for example, PNG [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics]).

[@http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)] is an
[@http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-comments XML specification]
and file format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.

SVG files (.svg) can be viewed with an Internet Browser:

* [@http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ Mozilla Firefox (version 3 and later)]

You may wish to associate Firefox with SVG files (or perhaps Inkview - see below).

* [@http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator Adobe Illustrator].


* [@http:/www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome browser]


* [@www.opera.com Opera] has [@http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/svg/ svg support]
but the quality of rendering is sometimes not as good as other browsers.

* Microsoft Internet Explorer, provided a suitable
[@http://www.adobe.com/svg/ Adobe SVG Viewer plug-in for SVG files] is installed.
Shamefully, even IE8 Beta does not yet offer SVG rendering.
(Adobe have stopped offering this for download (as they warned years ago)
but the download software can still be obtained elsewhere, for example from
[@http://adobe-svg-viewer.software.informer.com/download/ software.informer].
Information about limitations of IE with Vista and the Adobe add-in are given on the
[@http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html Adobe End of Line FAQ]).

* [@http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape], a fine Open Source SVG editor Inkscape and a viewer Inkview
with excellent rendering, full scaling and other editing features.

Inkview also allows window resizing, showing the scalability of SVG files without any loss of quality,
unlike bit image files that eventually reveal pixels as you expand the view.

You may find it especially convenient to use the viewer, Inkview, on Microsoft Windows,
and make this the default program for files of type .svg.
To do this, you will need to download install the Inkscape package.
Inkview.exe is included in the directory you chose for the install,
usually C:\program Files\Inkscape.  You will need to use the Explorer, Tools, Folder Options,
and add extension svg if necessary and then associate svg files with inkview.exe.

You may also find it convenient to add "c:\program Files\inkscape" to your Path using
Control Panel, System, Advanced system settings, Environment variables, Path, and edit
to append the folder.  You can then use commands like "inkview my_picture.svg" from a command window.

Inkview allows one to open many svg files as a slideshow
and move forward and backward (and back to start) with the cursor keys.

This works as expected using a command window,
for example after changing to the directory containing your SVG files,
and running "inkview *.svg" to display all the images in the directory as a slideshow.

Sadly, by default, if you select many files (but not more than 15!) in Windows Explorer,
multiple windows are opened instead of a slideshow.
If you know how to change this 'by design' feature, please tell me.

You can use this conveniently from your desktop (for example), by creating a shortcut to inkview.exe
(right click in the inkscape install directory and choose Create Shortcut).  Drag the shortcut to the desktop.
Append "*.svg" to the Target, usually \c "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\inkview.exe", or perhaps the name of
a single file.  If necessary, change Start in to the folder containing the svg files, for example,
\c C:\Users\Paul\Desktop\My_Plots\.  You can add comment describing what it will do, and change the
name of the shortcut file to something more helpful, for example, "View My Plots".

You may instead find it useful to create a batch file, for example called view_demo_plots.bat containing, for example:

  START "Inkview" /MIN inkview.exe  C:\Users\Paul\Desktop\My_Plots\*.svg

that will display all the svg images in folder \My_Plots in turn as the cursor keys are pressed.
Of course, you can also omit the folder specification, and just have `*.svg` when the location of the
batch file will determine which svg files are being viewed.

* Many other graphics programs, for example see
[@http://svg.software.informer.com/software/ Most popular SVG software].

The goals of the project are:

* To let users produce simple plots with minimal intervention by using sane defaults.
* To allow users to easily customize plots but allow very fine-grained control of appearance.
* To provide very high quality plots suitable for publication, including printing, but with tiny file sizes.
* To allow the user to talk to the plot classes using coordinate units
rather than pixels or other arbitrary units.
* To create the backbone of a `svg` class that can be extended to fully support
the standard.
* Compliance with the
[@http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ W3C Scalable Vector Graph standard].
