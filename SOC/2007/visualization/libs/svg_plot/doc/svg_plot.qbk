[section:preface Preface]

[heading Preface]
Humans have a fantastic capacity for visual understanding, and merely looking
at data organized in one, two, or three dimensions allows us to see relations
not otherwise visible in a list of numbers. Computers, however, deal with
information numerically, and C++ and the
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library Standard Template Library (STL)]
do not currently offer an easy way to bridge the gap.

This library aims to help the user to easily plot data that is stored in STL containers.

This project is focused on using STL containers in order to display data on a
one-dimensional, two-dimensional plot and boxplots.
The plot is written to a
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics Scalable Vector Graphic image]
(that can also be converted to other graph types,
for example, PNG [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics]).

[@http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)] is an
[@http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-comments XML specification]
and file format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.

SVG files (.svg) can be viewed with an Internet Browser:

* [@http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ Mozilla Firefox (version 3 and later)]

* [@http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator Adobe Illustrator].

* [@www.opera.com Opera] has [@http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/svg/ svg support]
but the quality of rendering is sometimes not as good as other browsers.

* Microsoft Internet Explorer, provided a suitable
[@http://www.adobe.com/svg/ Adobe SVG Viewer plug-in for SVG files] is installed.
Shamefully, even IE8 Beta does not yet offer SVG rendering.
(Adobe have stopped offering this for download (as they warned years ago)
but the download software can still be obtained elsewhere, for example from
[@http://adobe-svg-viewer.software.informer.com/download/ software.informer].
Information about limitations of IE with Vista and the Adobe add-in are given on the
[@http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html Adobe End of Line FAQ]).

* [@http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape], a fine Open Source SVG editor and viewer
with excellent rendering, full scaling and other editing features.

* [@www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome]

* Many other graphics programs, for example see
[@http://svg.software.informer.com/software/ Most popular SVG software].

The goals of the project are:

* To let users produce simple plots with minimal intervention by using sane defaults.
* To allow users to easily customize plots but allow very fine-grained control of appearance.
* To provide very high quality plots suitable for publication, including printing, but with tiny file sizes.
* To allow the user to talk to the plot classes using coordinate units
rather than pixels or other arbitrary units.
* To create the backbone of a `svg` class that can be extended to fully support
the standard.
* Compliance with the
[@http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ W3C Scalable Vector Graph standard].

[important This is not (yet) an official Boost library. It was a
[@http://code.google.com/soc/2007/boost/about.html Google Summer of Code project (2007)]
whose mentor organization was Boost. It remains a library under construction,
the code is quite functional, but interfaces, library structure, and names
