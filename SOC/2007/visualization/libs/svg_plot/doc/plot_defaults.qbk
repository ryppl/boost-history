There are certain defaults, tabulated below, that are true at the beginning of the plotting.

[table Default Values
  [[object] [Default value] [Rationale]]
  [[All colors not defined in this table] [black] [Coloring, if any, will be highly dependent on user needs.]]
  [[Axis] [On, internal style] [Most graphs include an axis of some kind. The internal axis style is used because this seems to be the default behavior in many textbooks I have owned.]]
  [[Coordinate precision] [3 decimal digits] [Sufficient 1 in 1000 precision for typical small plots. (Higher precision will increase svg file size).]]
  
  [[Distance between major X ticks] [`3 units`] [Reasonably fits into a plot window.]]
  [[Font size of the legend title] [12] [Reasonable when paired with the image size.]]
  [[Font size of the X Label] [12] [Reasonable when paired with the image size.]]
  [[Font size of the title] [30] [Makes the title stand out.]]
  [[Grid lines] [`All off`] [Grid lines are a user's personal choice, so default is none.]]
  [[Image background] [white] [Coloring, if any, will be highly dependent on user needs.]]
  [[Image size] [`500 by 350`] [Details discernable. The image is easily viewable by those using 800x600 monitors.]]
  [[Legend] [`Off`] [The goal of the defaults is to provide the cleanest possible plot as a default. Excluding the legend meets this goal.]]
  [[Legend background] [white] [Coloring, if any, will be highly dependent on user needs.]]
  [[Major tick length] [20 pixels] [Tasteful default when paired with the window size. This also makes the major ticks easily distinguishable from the minor ticks.]]
  [[Major tick width] [2 pixels] [Major ticks are more obvious than minor ticks.]]
  [[Minor tick length] [10 pixels] [Tasteful default when compared with the size of the grid. This makes the minor ticks less obvious than the major ticks.]]
  [[Minor tick width] [1 pixel] [This makes the minor tick less obvious than the major ticks.]]
  [[Number of minor X ticks between each major X tick] [2] [This allows the minor ticks to appear on the integer values.]]
  [[Plot Window] [`Off`] [Initially off because it is the simplest case.]]
  [[Plot window background] [white] [Coloring, if any, will be highly dependent on user needs.]]
  [[Title] [On, `"Plot of data"`] [The title is on because this is one of the most basic elements of a graph. The title is set to a default because when `title_on == true`, something should display.]]
  [[Title size] [`30`] [This is clearly visible in a variety of image sizes.]]
  [[X Axis Label] [`"X Axis"`, Off] ["X Axis" is the label because /something/ should display were the user to turn on the X-axis label without setting text.]]
  [[X Axis Label Size] [`12`] [This is a reasonable size at the default image size.]]
  [[X Grid (Major and Minor)] [Off] [Turned off in the interest of providing simple, clean plots.]]
  [[X Range] [`(-10, 10)`] [Traditional plot viewport (but almost all plots will need to set both X and Y ranges).]]

You may have noticed that there are certain defaults that are true at the 
beginning of the plotting. Here is a table of the defaults:
