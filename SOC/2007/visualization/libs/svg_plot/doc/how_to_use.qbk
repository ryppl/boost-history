[section:howtouse How To Use This Documentation]

* Tutorial pages are intended for those who do not know how to use the program.

  * The pages that begin with the tag "Tutorial: Simple" are for absolute beginners.

  * "Tutorial: Full" should give the intermediate user a good
    reference, as well as show how the program can be used

  * "Tutorial: Special" shows other features/options that the headers
    provide to the user.

* The pages labelled "*Reference*" give Doxygen reference information.
You can find all features with some descriptions, and some examples, in these sections.

* If you have a feature request, or if it appears that the implementation
is in error, please check the __todo page first, as well
as the __rationale section.

If you do not find your idea/complaint, please reach me either through the Boost
development list, or email me direct at pbristow (at) hetp (dot) u-net (dot) com
or jakevoytko (at) gmail (dot) com.
