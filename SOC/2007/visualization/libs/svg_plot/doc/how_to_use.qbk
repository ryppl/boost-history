* Tutorials are listed in the Table of Contents and include many examples that should help you get started quickly.

* Source code of the many Examples will often be your quickest option. They often deliberately use many features,
often producing examples of outstandingly bad taste!

* Reference section prepared using Doxygen will help fine-tuning the appearance of your graphs.

* Several indexes (especially the function index) will also help you find which of the several hundred options you need.

* If you have a feature request, or if it appears that the implementation
is in error, please check the __todo page first, as well
as the __rationale section.

If you do not find your idea/complaint, please reach me either through the Boost
development list, or email me direct at pbristow (at) hetp (dot) u-net (dot) com
or jakevoytko (at) gmail (dot) com.
