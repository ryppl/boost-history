[section:errors Type of errors]
The following sections will describe some of the errors that an user or a device can make. 
Those are the most frequent and we are not exhaustive, however we will find out how well our algorithms work.
We will calculate (in a mathematical way) the probability of failures and the factors which affect it.

[h5 Single error]
[h5 Multiple error]

[h4 Transposition]
