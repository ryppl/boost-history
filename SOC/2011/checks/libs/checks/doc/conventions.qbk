[section:conventions Document Conventions]

* [*Tutorials] are listed in the ['Table of Contents] and include many examples that should help you get started quickly.
* [*Source code] of the many ['Examples] will often be your quickest start.
* [*Reference section] prepared using Doxygen will provide the function and class signatures,
but there is also an ['index] of these. 
* The main ['index] will also help,
especially if you know a word describing what it does,
without needing to know the exact name chosen for the function.

This documentation makes use of the following naming and formatting conventions.

* C++ Code is in `fixed width font` and is syntax-highlighted.
* Other code is in [^teletype fixed-width font].
* Replaceable text that you will need to supply is in [~italics].
* If a name refers to a free function, it is specified like this:
  `free_function()`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `()`
  to indicate that it is a free function.
* If a name refers to a class template, it is specified like this:
  `class_template<>`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `<>`
  to indicate that it is a class template.
* If a name refers to a function-like macro, it is specified like this: `MACRO()`;
  that is, it is uppercase in code font and its name is followed by `()` to
  indicate that it is a function-like macro. Object-like macros appear without the
  trailing `()`.
* Names that refer to ['concepts] in the generic programming sense are
  specified in CamelCase.

* Many code snippets assume an implicit namespace, for example, `std::` or `boost::checks`.

* If you have a feature request, or if it appears that the implementation
is in error, please check the TODO section first, as well
as the rationale section.

If you do not find your idea/complaint, please reach the author either through the Boost
development list, or email the author(s) direct .
