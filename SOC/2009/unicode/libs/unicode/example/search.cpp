/*`
This example shows how to search a substring within a string,
at the grapheme level, using two methods.

In this example we're going to use =BOOST_AUTO= as the
return type of some of the functions is unspecified, but ideally
you should try to avoid that dependency by not naming the variables at all,
or rely on a type deduction system the library doesn't provide yet.
