<p>
      My project used textual configuration files extensively and was processing
      and preparing considerable amounts of data in XML for interprocess communications
      (tasks fairly common these days). Consequently, I had a need for a library
      that would provide unifying and extendable interface to convert various data
      between their 'native' (internal to an application) binary representations
      and external (predominantly textual, string-based) representations.
    </p>
<p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>boost::lexical_cast</em></span> library (with its orthogonal design
      and extendable deployment) looked very promising and was by far the preferred
      candidate compared to others (such as C functions, the <span class="emphasis"><em>std::stringstream</em></span>,
      etc., see <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill19.htm" target="_top">The String
      Formatters of Manor Farm by H. Sutter</a> for the discussion of alternatives).
    </p>
<p>
      Unfortunately, many user types/classes did not meet <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      requirements; the <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span> behavior of throwing an
      exception for a conversion failure was difficult to work with; additional conversion
      formatting and locale support were needed, etc.
    </p>
<p>
      After discussions with Kevlin Henney (the <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      author) and in the Boost Developers forum it was collectively decided that
      the requested extensions were not compatible with the idea of what <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      embodied and a dedicated family of conversion functions with richer interfaces
      was needed. That decision resulted in the development and the subsequent submission
      of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Boost.Convert</em></span> library described in this document.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Boost.Convert</em></span> was born out of the need for string-to-type
      and type-to-string conversions and due to limitations of <span class="emphasis"><em>boost::lexical_cast</em></span>.
      However, <span class="emphasis"><em>Boost.Convert</em></span> interface is intentionally generic
      to accommodate any type-to-type conversions if needed. Judging from <a href="http://www.boostpro.com/vault/index.php?action=downloadfile&amp;filename=conversion.zip&amp;directory=Utilities&amp;" target="_top">the
      Conversion Library submission by Vicente Botet (currently in the Boost Review
      Queue)</a> such a need might indeed exist. If so, such functionality can
      be implemented within the <span class="emphasis"><em>Boost.Convert</em></span> framework and
      accessed uniformly via <span class="emphasis"><em>Boost.Convert</em></span> interface.
