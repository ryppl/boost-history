README for Spirit v1.8.2

==============================================================================
The docs for Spirit are located in the libs/spirit/doc subdirectory.
The code is under the boost subdirectory.
The examples are in libs/spirit/example, and the test suite is in 
libs/spirit/test.
The Spirit homepage is http://spirit.sourceforge.net/

==============================================================================
Simply point your compiler's include path to the spirit directory.

There are no libraries to build, Spirit is a header-only library.

The examples can be built and the testsuite can be executed by using the 
Boost.Build system as described on the Boost pages: http://www.boost.org.

For example, using MSVC 7.1:

1) Download the Spirit distrib (you've already done that) and unpack it
   somewhere.
2) Download a prebuilt executable of bjam.exe here:
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941
   With the latest Boost Build, you don't have to configure the tool if you
   installed VC7.1 in the default location. Put it somewhere in your path.
3) Change to the directory to *this* directory.
4) Call bjam from the command line:
   
   bjam -sTOOLS=vc-7_1 test

==============================================================================
If you want to build spirit as thread safe, you have to define the 
BOOST_SPIRIT_THREADSAFE macro. Spirit uses the boost thread library, which 
is not distributed together with spirit. You will have to add the boost
headers to your include path.  You will also need to link with
libboost_thread library and your platform threading library.  

Of course this assumes that you already have boost_thread built, and you will
have to use the correct boost path.

==============================================================================
Here is a list of the examples that depend on software not in the main
spirit distribution:
application/slex/callback.cpp depends on boost/function.hpp
fundamental/regular_expression.cpp depends on boost regex (see docs)

None of these examples are built by default.
