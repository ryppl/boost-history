### Installation steps ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** REQUIREMENTS: MySql database, php 4.0.6 and higer (4.1.2+ recommended), a webserver (tested on Apache and IIS,should work anything else PHP will run with).

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver.  You will need to telnet/ssh into
the server for the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want. (On Linux type tar zxf filename.tar.gz to decompress)

3. After that you will need to cd into the sql/ folder under the webnotes
directory and locate the db_generate.sql file.  Run the following command:

mysql -u<username> -p<password> <databasename> < db_generate.sql

Then you will need to upgrade the db to the latest (that's only needed if you have
downloaded a CVS version).

mysql -u<username> -p<password> <databasename> < db_upgrade.sql

If you installed MySQL from source code you may have to add /usr/local/mysql/bin/ infront of those commands

You could also cut and paste the sql statements from db_generate.sql into a
package like phpMyAdmin.  You will need to have created the database ahead of
time.

4. Create core/custom_config_inc.php which overrides the default values in
config_defaults_inc.php.  You can edit directly the config_defaults_inc.php but 
this will make it harder to upgrade to future releases of phpWebNotes.  In particular you
will want to set the database variables:  hostname, username, password, and
database name.  These must be set to match the configuration of your webserver and mysql
database.  Also, don't forget to input the correct directory paths.

5.  For every page that you want notes to be available you will need to convert
their extension to one that is interpreted by PHP (Such as .php).  Then:

Insert the following inside the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tag):

&lt;?
	require_once('/mypath/core/api.php'); # replace with actual path
	pwn_head();
?&gt;

Insert the following into the bottom of the document (before the &lt;/body&gt; tag):

&lt;?
	pwn_body( 'my-page-logical-name', $PHP_SELF, $page_prev, $page_next, $page_parent );
?&gt;

You can replace the 'my-page-logical-name' with __FILE__ or basename( __FILE__ ) 
if you don't want to assign ids to the pages.

The require_once argument should be the absolute path to your installation of
phpWebNotes.  It should not be relative to what your browser would see.
This way if you have lots of files in different directories you will always
be able to add the web note functionality to each page.

6. If you want the pages to auto-index (register themselves) in the database
(default) then skip the next step.

7.  You will need to index the files in your website.  Open up the phpWebNotes
directory in your web browser and login.  The default username and password is
administrator / root.  You should change this later on!  Open up the "File
Index" page.  Select the root directory and then choose the Index button.  It
indexes all files in the directory it is located in and all subdirectories.

8. If you need the notes to be moderated before they appear on the webpage then
leave $g_auto_accept_notes = OFF, otherwise set it to ON and go to step 11.

9.  Notes will be added as pending.  They need to be approved by the moderator/
administrator before they will become visible.  This can be done by loggin in and
then visiting the page.  All notes will have the actions next to them, to approve
a note, the [ Accept ] action should be clicked.

10.  You can edit or delete notes later on by going to the page.  This option will 
only be available if you have logged in as a moderator/administrator.

11. The next step is to get the sample working.  This depends on the auto-index feature.
For each page we need to index it, and add links to parent, previous, and next. All
these links can only be established if the page we are linking to is already linked.
Hence, we need to visit each page to index it, and we also need to visit it again when
all its neighbours are indexed and already visited (i.e. they know they own urls).

### Troubleshooting ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* PROBLEM:  Warning messages prevent you from viewing or adding notes.

SOLUTION: Your error_level is too high.  Open up your php.ini (or php3.ini)
and lower it.  There should be enough comments around the variable to help you
out.

* PROBLEM:  After upgrading from phpWebNotes 1.0.0, I can not login.

SOLUTION: Users were created in version 1.0.0 with enabled equal to 0.  This was not
a problem in v1.0.0 because the enabled field was ignored.  However, in v2.0.0 enabled
is checked.  In order to solve this problem, login to the database and set the enabled
flag to 1 for the accounts that you need enabled.

* PROBLEM: Adding notes does nothing

SOLUTION: You may have track_vars set to Off (or 0).  Set this to On in your
php.ini file.  As of version 4.0.3 and newer it is set to On by default.

* PROBLEM: phpWebNotes does not work under PHP 4.2 and 4.3

SOLUTION: phpWebNotes requires register_globals to be on which used to be enabled
by default in 4.1.2 and older. 4.2.0 and newer have it set to Off as default so
you will have to set register_globals to On in php.ini
