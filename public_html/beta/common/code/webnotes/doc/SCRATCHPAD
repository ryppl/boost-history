SCRATCH PAD
-----------------------------------------

To-Do list:

 * Be able to reverse the display order (vb: they may already be supported)
 * Add access_api.php - note_accept() / decline() / update() / delete() should check the access level.
 * Consider supporting html only pages.  This can be done by a php loader page + some other tricks (output buffering?)
 * Indexing page
   * Add a link next to each file to open it for viewing.
 * API mode for plugability into existing systems.
 * Add note on how to parse HTML files through the PHP interpreter.
