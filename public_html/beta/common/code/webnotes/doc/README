phpWebNotes is a PHP based solution to letting users add their own comments to
a document.  It is heavily modelled after the example set by php.net.

This project was originally conceived to help people who maintain technical
help docs and how-tos.  It is more direct than searching through a forum and
less involving for the users than signing up for a mailing list.  Of course,
it adapts to other uses easily.

Updating documents is tedious and documents often lack the real world
examples and experience to make them truly useful.  The best help sites we have
ever found had not only detailed documentation but lots and lots of examples
and problems and quirks that appear in real life.  Unfortunately this rules
out many man pages (unix help docs).  Allowing user comments lets the doc
maintainer do less work.  Whenever the maintainer needs to update the doc they
can just roll in the user feedback instead of recreating the information.
This sort of automation cuts down on email and mailing list traffic as well.

You will need to have PHP, MySql, and a web server.  You don't need
to know too much about any of them other than how to set them up and some basic
administration commands.

The team would appreciate an email letting us know if you find this program
useful.  This information will not be published without permission, it will just
provide the team with the feedback that this have proven to be useful for some
people and hence will motivate the team to put more effort into it.  Also this
feedback is what we need to keep improving phpWebNotes.
