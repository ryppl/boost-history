[section New License]
A unified [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/license_info.html Boost Software License] has
been developed and will gradually replace the individual licenses for most
Boost libraries. The new license offers better legal protection for both users
and developers, and should speed user's legal reviews of Boost libraries. Dave
Abrahams led the Boost effort to develop better licensing. The legal team was
led by [@http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/cabell/index.html Diane Cabell],
Director, Clinical Programs, [@http://cyber.law.harvard.edu Berkman Center for
Internet & Society], Harvard Law School.
[@http://www.nixonpeabody.com/attorneys_detail1.asp?ID=121 Devin Smith],
attorney, [@http://www.nixonpeabody.com/default.asp Nixon Peabody LLP], wrote
the Boost License. Eva Chan, Harvard Law School, contributed analysis of issues
and drafts of various legal documents.

Note: Many of the Boost libraries are still using earlier licenses, though all
conform to the [@/development/requirements.html#license Boost License
Requirements]. After this release we will begin an effort to move toward
uniform use of the new license.

[section Build and Installation]

* New [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/getting_started.html Getting Started] procedures
  ease download and installation, from Rene Rivera and others.

* Improved support for libraries requiring
  [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/separate_compilation.html separate
  compilation], from John Maddock and others.

[section New Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/utility/enable_if.html enable_if]:] Selective
  inclusion of function template overloads, from Jaakko Jarvi, Jeremiah
  Willcock, and Andrew Lumsdaine. This is an important new technique which
  exploits the SFINAE (substitution-failure-is-not-an-error) principle.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/variant/index.html Variant
  Library]:] Safe, generic, stack-based discriminated union container, from
  Eric Friedman and Itay Maman.

[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/compose/index.htm Compose]:] This
  library has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use
  [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/bind/bind.html Bind] or
  [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/lambda/doc/index.html Lambda] instead.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/date_time/doc/index.html Date Time
  Library]:] A whole host of bug fixes, new features, and documentation
  improvements. See the Date Time Change History for details.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm Filesystem
  Library]:] Several added functions, including improved checking for directory
  and file name portability.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/iterator/doc/index.html Iterator
  Library]:] Major version upgrade, with interface as proposed for the C++
  library TR, including an improved [^iterator_adaptor] design plus several new
  components, from David Abrahams, Jeremy Siek, and Thomas Witt.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/multi_array/index.html MultiArray]:] The
  [^multi_array] class template now provides an element-preserving resize
  operation as well as default construction (see the
  [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/multi_array/doc/reference.html reference manual] for more
  information).
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/index.html Python Library]:] 
  * Support for Python 2.3 and Intel C++ on Linux
  * Container [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/doc/v2/indexing.html Indexing Suite] added.
  * injected constructors and wrapped function objects.
  * wrapping static data members.
  * `std::wstring` conversions.
  * Improved [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/doc/v2/args.html keyword arguments].
  * Better error messages, including name demangling for GCC.
  * Simpler [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/doc/building.html build procedure].
  * ['...and more....]
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/random/index.html Random Number
  Library]:] Interface changed to match the C++
  [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/random/wg21-proposal.html TR proposal], from Jens
  Maurer.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/regex/doc/index.html Regex]:] Completely new
  matching algorithm is now much faster than before, plus a selection of
  [@/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/regex/doc/history.html new features and enhancements].
