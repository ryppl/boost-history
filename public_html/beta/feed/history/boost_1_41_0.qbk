[section New Libraries]

[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/date_time/index.html DateTime]:]
  * The default format for time durations is now "`%-%O:%M:%S%F`" instead of
    "`%-%H:%M:%S%F`" that was used previously. In order to retain the old
    behavior, the format string has to be specified explicitly during the time
    IO facet construction
    ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/1861 #1861]).
  * Gregorian dates now use 32-bit integer type internally on 64-bit platforms
    ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3308 #3308]).
  * See the
    [@/doc/html/date_time/details.html#date_time.changes full changelog]
    for more detail.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html Multi-index Containers]:]
  Maintenance fixes. Consult the library
  [@/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html#boost_1_41 release notes] for
  further information.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/python/index.html Python]:]
  Boost.Python now supports Python 3 (Haoyu Bai's Google Summer of Code
  project, mentored by Stefan Seefeld).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/spirit/index.html Spirit]:] This is the initial 
  official release of the new Spirit V2.1, a completely new library
  for parsing, lexing, and output generation.
  Note: this release is not backwards compatible with earlier versions.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/wave/index.html Wave]:]
  See the [@/libs/wave/ChangeLog changelog] for details.

[section Boost.CMake moved]

The cmake version of boost has moved; the Boost.CMmake release will be
separate and will lag the main release slightly, but will also be
capable of producing patch releases as necessary.

More information on the [@https:://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMake
Boost CMake wiki page/].
