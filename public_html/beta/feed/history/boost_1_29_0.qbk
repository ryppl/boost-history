  Dates, times, leap seconds, infinity, and more, from Jeff Garland.

  'printf-like' format operations, from Samuel Krempp.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/function/index.html Function Library]:] Major
  syntactic changes have been made. Some old syntax and little-used features
  have been deprecated (and will be removed shortly), and the syntax for the

  compilers. Please see the compatibility note for more information.

  Managed signals & slots callback implementation, from Doug Gregor.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/test/doc/index.html Test Library]:] Major new
