[section Important - New Toolset Names]

The names of some the Boost.Build
[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/getting_started.html#Tools toolsets] have been changed
to remove the "[^.]" (dot) character and to fix some other naming
inconsistencies. For example, [^vc7.1] toolset was renamed to become [^vc-7_1].
Please refer to the [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/getting_started.html#Tools
Supported Toolsets] section of the installation guide for the complete list of
the current toolset names. This change was made as a part of the effort to make
the Boost distribution compatible with ISO 9660 level 2 requirements.

[section Updated Libraries]

* Compose: This deprecated library has been removed.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/index.html Graph]:] 
  * Added [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/bundles.html bundled properties] to the
    [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_list.html `adjacency_list`] and
    [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_matrix.html `adjacency_matrix`] class
    templates, greatly simplifying the introduction of internal vertex and edge
    properties.
  * The [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/leda_conversion.html LEDA graph
    adaptors] have been ported to LEDA 4.5.
  * Added algorithms for [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/betweenness_centrality.html
    betweenness centrality] and [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/bc_clustering.html
    betweenness centrality clustering].
  * Added [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/circle_layout.html circle layout] and
    [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/kamada_kawai_spring_layout.html
    undirected spring layout] algorithms.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html MPL Library]:] 
  * Updated to use the Boost Software License.
  * New [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html documentation], including a complete
    [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/refmanual.html reference manual.]
  * Major interface changes and improvements, many of which are not backward
    compatible. Please refer to the
    [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/tutorial/changes-in-boost-1-32-0.html 1.32
    changelog] for the detailed information about upgrading to the new version.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/python/doc/index.html Python Library]:] 
  * Updated to use the Boost Software License.
  * a new,
  * [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/exposing.html#python.class_virtual_functions
    better method of wrapping classes with virtual functions] has been
    implemented.
  * Support for the new Python Bool type, thanks to Daniel Holth.
  * Support for upcoming GCC symbol export control features have been folded
    in, thanks to Niall Douglas.
  * Improved support for `std::auto_ptr`-like types.
  * Components used by other libraries have been moved out of [^python/detail]
    and into [^boost/detail] to improve dependency relationships.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes and compiler workarounds.
* [phrase library..[/html/signals.html Signals Library]:] Introduced
  deterministic slot ordering, permitting slots to be connected at the
  beginning or end of slot groups or the slot list itself. Combiners may safely
  have state and are accessible from the signal.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/utility/utility.htm Utility]:] class
  template [@/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/utility/utility.htm#result_of result_of]

[section Regression tests]

This release has been extensively tested on a variety of different compilers
and platforms. It is known to contain no regressions against the previous
reference release on the compilers and configurations tested. Please refer to
the corresponding
[@http://www.meta-comm.com/engineering/boost-regression/1_32_0/index.html
regression reports] to see how well your compiler performs on the new Boost
codebase.

[@/users/people/aleksey_gurtovoy.htm Aleksey Gurtovoy] managed this release.
[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/release_procedures.htm Managing a release] at all is an
enormous job, and Aleksey always goes beyond merely meeting requirements by
insisting on the highest possible quality. The Boost membership owes him a debt
of gratitude.

This release wouldn't have been possible without the dedicated effort of many,
many members of the Boost community who generously contributed their
outstanding expertise, time and energy to making it happen. For patches, bug
fixes, troubleshooting, expert advice, and prompt responses to the release
manager's requests we thank:

David Abrahams, Misha Bergal, Jonathan Brandmeyer, Fernando Cacciola, Marshall
Clow, Christopher Currie, Pavol Droba, Caleb Epstein, Eric Friedman, Jeff

Also, our special thanks go to: John Maddock for the managing the effort of
converting the majority of the Boost libraries to the
[@/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/license_info.html Boost Software License], Eric Niebler
and Joel de Guzman for taking on the important job of improving the Boost
documentation's look and feel, and last, but not least, to our regression test
runners, without whom we simply would never have released: Toon Knapen, Bronek
Kozicki, Rene Rivera, Markus Schopflin, Stefan Slapeta, Victor A. Wagner Jr.
and Martin Wille.

Thank you everybody!
