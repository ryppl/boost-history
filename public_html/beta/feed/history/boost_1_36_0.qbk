    When adding libraries:

    1. Libraries are listed in alphabetical order.
    2. Besides the dedicated entry, the lib name should be added to the
       [purpose] section at the beginning of the page.

[section New Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/accumulators/index.html Accumulators]:] Framework for
  incremental calculation, and collection of statistical accumulators, from Eric Niebler.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/exception/doc/boost-exception.html Exception]:] 
  A library for transporting of arbitrary data in exception objects, and transporting of exceptions between threads, from Emil Dotchevski.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/units/index.html Units]:]
  Zero-overhead dimensional analysis and unit/quantity manipulation and conversion, from Matthias Schabel and Steven Watanabe
* [phrase library..[@/libs/unordered/index.html Unordered]:] 
  Unordered associative containers, from Daniel James.

[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/asio/index.html Asio]:]
  * Added support for serial ports.
  * Added support for UNIX domain sockets.
  * Added support for raw sockets and ICMP.
  * Added wrappers for POSIX stream-oriented file descriptors (excluding regular files).
  * Added wrappers for Windows stream-oriented `HANDLE`s such as named pipes (requires `HANDLE`s that work with I/O completion ports).
  * Added wrappers for Windows random-access `HANDLE`s such as files (requires `HANDLE`s that work with I/O completion ports).
  * Added support for reactor-style operations (i.e. they report readiness but perform no I/O) using a new `null_buffers` type.
  * Added an iterator type for bytewise traversal of buffer sequences.
  * Added new `read_until()` and `async_read_until()` overloads that take a user-defined function object for locating message boundaries.
  * Added an experimental two-lock queue (enabled by defining `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_TWO_LOCK_QUEUE`) that may provide better `io_service` scalability across many processors.
  * Various fixes, performance improvements, and more complete coverage of the custom memory allocation support.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/assign/index.html Assign]:]
  `list_of()` (and its variants) now has overloaded comparison operators. This
  allows you to write test code such as
  `BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL( my_container, list_of(2)(3)(4)(5) );`.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/foreach/index.html Foreach]:] `BOOST_FOREACH` macro for
  easily iterating over the elements of a sequence, from Eric Niebler.
  * New `BOOST_REVERSE_FOREACH` macro for iterating over a sequence in reverse.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/function/index.html Function]:] 
  * Improved allocator support, from Emil Dotchevski.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/functional/hash/index.html Hash]:]
  Minor updates and fixes, for more info see the
  [@/doc/html/hash/changes.html#hash.changes.boost_1_36_0 change log].
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/index.html Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * Fixed missing move semantics on managed memory classes.
  * Added copy_on_write and open_read_only options for shared memory
    and mapped file managed classes.
  * `shared_ptr` is movable and supports aliasing.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/intrusive/index.html Intrusive]:]
  * Added `linear<>` and `cache_last<>` options to singly linked lists.
  * Added `optimize_multikey<>` option to unordered container hooks.
  * Optimized unordered containers when `store_hash` option is used
    in the hook.
  * Implementation changed to avoid explicit use of `try`-`catch`
    blocks and be compilable with exceptions disabled.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/index.html Math]:]
  * Added new non-central Chi-Square, Beta, F and T distributions.
  * Added Exponential Integral and Zeta special functions.
  * Added Rounding, Truncation, and Unit-in-the-last-place functions.
  * Added support for compile time powers of a runtime base.
  * Added a few SSE2 based optimisations for the Lanczos approximations.
* [phrase library..[@/doc/html/mpi.html MPI]:]
  * Added support for non-blocking operations in Python, from Andreas Kl√∂ckner.
  * Added support for graph topologies.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html Multi-index Containers]:]
  Minor additions and maintenance fixes. Consult the library
  [@/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html#boost_1_36 release notes] for
  further information.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/ptr_container/index.html PtrContainer]:]
  Support for a few more containers, and addition of insert iterators.
  For details see
  [@/libs/ptr_container/doc/ptr_container.html#upgrading-from-boost-v-1-35
  upgrading details].
* [phrase library..[@/libs/spirit/index.html Spirit]:]
  Integrated the "Classic" Spirit V1.8.x code base with Spirit V2, "The
  New Generation". See [@/libs/spirit/classic/change_log.html Change Log].
* [phrase library..[@/libs/thread/index.html Thread]:]
  * New generic `lock` and `try_lock` functions for locking multiple mutexes at once.
  * Rvalue reference support for move semantics where the compilers supports it.
  * A few bugs fixed and missing functions added (including the serious win32 condition variable bug).
  * `scoped_try_lock` types are now backwards-compatible with Boost 1.34.0 and previous releases.
  * Support for passing function arguments to the thread function by supplying additional arguments to the `thread` constructor.
  * Backwards-compatibility overloads added for `timed_lock` and `timed_wait` functions to allow use of `xtime` for timeouts.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/wave/index.html Wave]:] 
  * Wave V2.0 is a new major release introducing some breaking API changes, 
    preventing it to be used with Boost versions earlier than V1.36.0. 
    Mainly, the API and hook interface have been streamlined for more 
    consistency.
  * Fixed a couple of bugs, improved regression test system to include testing 
    of the preporcessing hooks interface (for details see: 
    [@/libs/wave/ChangeLog Changelog]).
* [phrase library..[@/libs/xpressive/index.html Xpressive]:] 
  Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates,
  and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power of
  context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler.
  * `skip()` for specifying which parts of the input sequence to ignore when
    matching it against a regex.
  * `regex_replace()` accepts formatter objects and formatter expressions
    in addition to format strings.
  * Range-based `regex_replace()` algorithm.
  * Fix crash when semantic actions are placed in look-aheads, look-behinds or
    independent sub-expressions.
