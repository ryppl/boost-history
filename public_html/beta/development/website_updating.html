              <h2>Getting Content</h2>

              <p>The website content lives in
                  the <a href="http://svn.boost.org">Boost Subversion
                  repository</a>. To get the website content, retrieve
                  the <tt>website</tt> module from the Boost
                  Subversion repository. For example:</p>

              <pre>
svn co https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/website
</pre>

              <h2>Existing Page</h2>

              <p>The web content is structured to be as simple as possible to
              make generic editing possible. At minimum only a text editor
              and <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.com/" class=
              "external">HTML Tidy</a> are needed to edit content. The
              content uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" class=
              "external">XHTML 1.0 Strict</a> for various reasons, the most
              important being to increase accessibility and to enforce the
              separation of style from content. After getting the content you
              want to edit as above, make the changes you want and run the
              result through HTML Tidy with these options:</p>
              <pre>
tidy --tidy-mark no -i -wrap 78 -m -asxhtml --doctype strict <i>fname</i>
</pre>

              <p>Running HTML Tidy with a consistent set of options also
              helps in keeping an accurate change history in the repository. 
              There are <a href="/development/exemplar.html">examples</a> of 
              the kinds of styles supported either directly or through the use 
              of [<tt>class="<i>value</i>"</tt>] attributes for the various
              XHTML tags. Please pay attention to any errors and warnings that
              HTML Tidy mentions and strive to remove all of them.</p>

              <p>The pages should be viewable in most browsers. If possible
              test you changes in as many as possible. Preferably at least
              with IE and one other modern browser if you are on Windows. But
              if you are on another platform testing with the "default"
              browser is best. Normally viewing the page in outside of the a
              web server context will only show you the content and part of
              the footer. This is because the site uses Server Side Includes
              (SSI) which most browsers will not process. To look at the
              complete content you will need to either run your own Apache
              server, or wait for the <a href="http://beta.boost.org/" class=
              "external">test site</a> to update with the new content (which
                may take several minutes after check-in).</p>

              <h2>New Page</h2>

              <p>To make adding new pages easier there is a <a href=
              "/workplace/template.html">template</a> to get one started. To
              start, copy the template to the section of the website you want
              to add to and name the new file with a reasonably clear name.
              The section is up to you but the intended type of content for
              each is:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt><dfn>Introduction</dfn></dt>

                <dd>Content to help new users understand what Boost is
                for and what it is about. This is the one place where new
                visitors are going to visit. Directory:
                <tt>website/users</tt></dd>

                <dt><dfn>Community</dfn></dt>

                <dd>For users who are interested in participating, or are
                already participitating, this section describes how the Boost
                community of users and developers functions. Directory:
                <tt>website/community</tt></dd>

                <dt><dfn>Development</dfn></dt>

                <dd>Prospective or existing Boost developers make use of this
                section to quickly get to the most frequetly used content.
                This section is intended to hold the references to resources
                or directly include content that changes frequently. Or
                content that only pertains to library developers, although it
                may be of more widespread interest as users become more
                involved in the Boost community. Directory:
                <tt>website/development</tt></dd>

                <dt><dfn>Support</dfn></dt>

                <dd>Content to help users in getting problems resolved can go
                here. This would include both public support as informally
                provided by the Boost developers and the over all Boost
                community and commercial support when available. Directory:
                <tt>website/support</tt></dd>

                <dt><dfn>Documentation</dfn></dt>

                <dd>This section organizes documents specific to the Boost
                libraries. This includes at minimum the library documentation
                published with each of the Boost releases. Also included is
                access to the community maintained Wiki. Directory:
                <tt>website/support</tt></dd>
              </dl>

              <p>To provide the section user interface look and feel there
              are some changes that need to be done to the template:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Each section has a different CSS style reference
                  included in the <tt>head</tt> section. This reference needs
                  to change to one of:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Introduction: <tt>/style/section-boost.css</tt></li>

                    <li>Community: <tt>/style/section-community.css</tt></li>

                    <li>Development:
                    <tt>/style/section-development.css</tt></li>

                    <li>Support: <tt>/style/section-support.css</tt></li>

                    <li>Documentation: <tt>/style/section-doc.css</tt></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Each section displays a different context sensitive
                  sidebar menu through the use of SSI. The reference to the
                  sidebar to display needs to change in the <tt>sidebar</tt>
                  section to one of:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Introduction:
                    <tt>/common/sidebar-boost.html</tt></li>

                    <li>Community:
                    <tt>/common/sidebar-community.html</tt></li>

                    <li>Development:
                    <tt>/common/sidebar-development.html</tt></li>

                    <li>Support: <tt>/common/sidebar-support.html</tt></li>

                    <li>Documentation: <tt>/common/sidebar-doc.html</tt></li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In the <tt>sidebar</tt> section there are two menus
                  included the first is common to all the pages and contains
                  the download link and search box. Do not replace that
                  sidebar (<tt>/common/sidebar-common.html</tt>). It's the
                  second <tt>#include</tt> that should be changed to reflect
                  the current section.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Since this is a new page, you will also need to insert
                  your own corresponding copyright in the footer.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>To insert the new content you need to insert it into the
                  <tt>section-body</tt> section. Replace the <tt>{stuff}</tt>
                  placeholder with the content you want. In addition you
                  might also want to change the title, in the <tt>head</tt>,
                  and in the <tt>section-title</tt> section.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>In addition to the immediate content for the new page one
              needs to add an entry to the page so it can be accessed from
              the sidebar and index. See below...</p>

              <h2>Menus, Sidebars, and Index</h2>

              <p>The various navigation elements are structured to make
              adding new entries easy and to keep all places where wuch
              entries show consistent. To do this the site makes use of SSI
              to reduce the locations that have those entries to
              <em>one</em>. This means that changing it at the single common
              place one doesn't have to worry about changing all the pages,
              they all reflect the new content immediately. To add items to
              the various section menus edit the corresponding menu file in
              the <tt>website/common</tt> directory:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Introduction: <tt>/common/menu-boost.html</tt></li>

                <li>Community: <tt>/common/menu-community.html</tt></li>

              </ul>
