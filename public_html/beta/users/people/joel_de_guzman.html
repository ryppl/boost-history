              Joel got into electronics and programming in the 80s because
              almost everything in music, his first love, is becoming
              electronic and digital. Back then, he used to build his own
              guitars, effect boxes and synths. He enjoys playing
              distortion-laden rock guitar, composes and produces his own
              music in his home studio.</p>

              <p>In the 90s, he went to Japan and worked there as a software
              engineer. There, he learned C++ and immediately fell in love
              it. He's still trying his best to master the language in all
              its immensity.</p>

              <p>Joel is quite adept in writing code using modern C++
              techniques such as template metaprogramming and C++ functional
              programming. He's very happy and enthusiastic with his current
              job as a consultant and engineer at <a href=
              "http://www.boost-consulting.com" class="external">Boost
              Consulting</a>.</p>
