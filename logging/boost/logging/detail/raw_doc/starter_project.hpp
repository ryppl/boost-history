/** 
@page starter_project A starter project...

You've probably looked at the @ref common_scenarios "scenarios", at @ref scenario_multiple_files "basic_usage example",
and just in case, here's a something to get you started in your own project(s). 

You need 2 files:
- @c log.h - where you declare your log(s)
- @c log.cpp - where you define and initialize your log(s)

Again, this is just a starter project, you can customize it as you wish. Enjoy!

\n\n
The log.h file

@include starter/log.h

\n\n
The log.cpp file

@include starter/log.cpp
