This is an implementation of Boost.signals which is intended to be
thread-safe.  There have been some changes to the API to support
thread-safety.  See the html documentation in the doc/html subdirectory
for more information.

This implementation is header-only.  It should be useable by simply adding
this directory to your include path when compiling.  Be sure to place
this directory before the path to your full boost headers.

The latest version of this library should be available from the
boost sandbox cvs:

http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=53513

The files for thread_safe_signals are in
boost-sandbox/boost/
boost-sandbox/boost/thread_safe_signals and
boost-sandbox/libs/thread_safe_signals.
The boost-sandbox also has another thread-safe signals
implementation by Timmo Stange which uses the regular naming
scheme for the signals library (signal.hpp, signals/connection.hpp, etc.).
This library is stored in the cvs under an alternate naming scheme
(thread_safe_signal.hpp, thread_safe_signals/connection.hpp, etc.).
