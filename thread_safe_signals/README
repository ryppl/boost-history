This is an implementation of Boost.signals which is intended to be
thread-safe.  There have been some changes to the API to support
thread-safety.  See the html documentation in the 
libs/thread_safe_signals/doc/html subdirectory for more information.

This implementation is header-only.  It should be useable by simply adding
this directory to your include path when compiling.  Be sure to place
this directory before the path to your full boost headers.

The web page for thread_safe_signals is at:

http://www.comedi.org/projects/thread_safe_signals/doxygen/index.html

The latest version of this library should be available from the
boost sandbox svn:

http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/BoostSubversion

The files for thread_safe_signals are in the thread_safe_signals
subdirectory of the sandbox.  You can check out a copy of the files with the
following command:

svn co http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/thread_safe_signals thread_safe_signals
