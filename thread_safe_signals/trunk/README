This is an implementation of Boost.signals which is intended to be
thread-safe.  There have been some changes to the API to support
thread-safety.  See the html documentation in the 
"libs/signals2/doc/html" subdirectory for more information.

This implementation is header-only.  It should be useable by simply adding
this directory to your include path when compiling.  However, it does depend
on the Boost.thread library if you use the multi_threaded ThreadingModel for
your signals.  Be sure to place this directory before the path to your 
full boost headers.

The web page for thread_safe_signals is at:

http://www.comedi.org/projects/signals2/libs/signals2/doc/html/index.html

Releases should also contain the html documentation, under the 
subdirectory libs/thread_safe_signals/doc/html/

The latest version of this library should be available from the
boost sandbox svn:

http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/BoostSubversion

The files for thread_safe_signals are in the thread_safe_signals
subdirectory of the sandbox.  You can check out a copy of the files with the
following command:

svn co http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/thread_safe_signals/trunk signals2
