[section:tutorial Tutorial]

[heading Basic Container Printing]


All of the explore library can be used by simply including the `"explore.hpp"` 
header file.

  ``''''''``#include <boost/explore.hpp>
  ``''''''``using namespace boost::explore;

However, this will pull in definitions of all the containers that Explore supports. To include only the definitions required for a
specific container include each type's header file instead of `"explore.hpp"`.

  ``''''''``#include <boost/explore/vector.hpp>
  ``''''''``#include <boost/explore/boost_array.hpp>

[heading Printing of Contained Items]

Once you have included the proper header files, containers can be be streamed in a formated manner.

   std::vector<int> vi;
   vi.push_back(1);
   vi.push_back(2);
   vi.push_back(3);
   std::cout << vi;

prints

   [1, 2, 3]

The beginning of the container will be marked with a '\[' and the end will be marked with a '\]'. Each item in the container will be seperated by 
a ', ' to allow for easier identification of each item.

Containers that contain other containers will print the child containers using the same format for the parent, their children, their children's 
children, etc.

   std::vector<std::vector<int> > vvi;
   vvi.push_back(vi);
   vvi.push_back(vi);
   std::cout << vvi;

prints

   [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

[heading C Style Arrays]

C style arrays have a standard streaming format, however, when you include any explore header, including `"explore.hpp"` and 
`"boost/explore/c_array.hpp"`, you override this default streaming format with the explore streaming format and all the abilities of it.

   int arr[3] = {1,2,3};
   std::cout << arr;

prints

   [1, 2, 3]

[heading Associative Containers]

Associate containers are typically implemented using some form of pair-like container. So you might expect the following

   std::map<int,std::string> mis;
   mis.insert(std::make_pair(1, "first"));
   mis.insert(std::make_pair(2, "second"));
   mis.insert(std::make_pair(3, "third"));
   std::cout << mis;

would print this way

   [[1, first], [2, second], [3, third]]

But this format doesn't describe the associative nature of the elements well. So, explore uses special delimeters for the associations within 
associative containers, and the above code prints in a clearer format.

   [1:first, 2:second, 3:third]

Currently, the only containers that explore recognizes as associative are:

* std::map
* std::multimap

[link boost_explore.tutorial.custom_containers Custom containers] can be handled as associative containers.

[heading lexical_cast]

Because explore works with streaming operators, boost::lexical_cast will work with the explore library to allow you to create strings with the 
printed output of explore for cases when you don't want to use streaming directly.

   std::vector<int> vi;
   vi.push_back(1);
   vi.push_back(2);
   vi.push_back(3);
   std::cout << boost::lexical_cast<std::string>(vi);

prints

   [1, 2, 3]
