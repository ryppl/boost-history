    // All properties can have metadata associated to them. In the current form we store
    // instances of the Editor class with each property (see "Areas that need work" below
    // for where I admit this is too specific of a design). If you don't specify the Editor
    // object in your call to add_property, the property system tries to find a default Editor
    // based on the property type. None of the above examples specify an Editor, so they are
    // all defaulted.

    // Here is an example of accessing metadata for a specified property.

    /*
    Areas that need work:

    1) Generic Metadata: Properties need to have metadata associated with them so that the system can learn more about
    them. However, this metadata is system specific. I don't want to force everyone to use my metadata, when they will
    likely need something completely different. Currently the property system is built for our simulation's needs, so
    this metadata is hardcoded to the types it wants. This needs to be made generic. Perhaps use boost::any or maybe
    an additional key/value pair component would work. Either way, it would be nice to try to keep the auto-selection of
    metadata that already exists in the system.

    2) Algorithms: We currently only have one path based search algorithm. This expects a single matching value and
    throws otherwise. This is a useful search algorithm as is, but we need more. We need one that returns iterators
    over all the items found. We need a version of that that returns them as they exist in the system, and one that
    returns them sorted based on a given criteria. I also imagine there may be other algorithms for processing entire
    property trees, or sub-trees. For example, we have a serialization algorithm that walks the entire tree and stores
    the values of all properties. Given the same tree structure, it can re-walk the tree and set the values to their
    stored values.

    3) More compile time optimizations: There are a lot of powerful things you can do by creating properties at runtime.
    However, our experience shows that most properties are simple, and everything about them is known at compile time.
    There should be some template mechanism we could use for creating this type of property that would reduce the amount
    of time that is used at runtime to setup the property without reducing the utility of the system to create properties
    purely at runtime.

    4) Property Manager Singleton: Currently the property manager is a singleton. This has been extremely helpful in
    allowing us to build out the full property group tree and access it from anywhere. However, some people have
    an aversion to this pattern, and there are cases where you may want multiple managers (if you have multiple copies
    of your data layer, you probably don't want all those copies combined into the same property group tree). We haven't
    really thought much further on how to do this better and are looking for insights.
     
    5) Safe Property Group: This is something I've been toying around with for a while. Currently it is advantagious to
    get a property group and hold on to it. However, since property groups are retrieved largely as pointers, this can
    be dangerious. I can't use shared_ptr since the object that it is pointing to may have been created on the stack,
    and it won't have control over deletion (among other issues). I have a prototype class that wraps the property group
    and listens to the property manager to see when it is destroyed, but I'm not sure I like that idea (and it is part of
    our C++/CLI wrapper, so it isn't something I can share).

    6) Documentation: We currently have doxygen documented objects for this code. If we are going to submit to boost, we
    would need quickbook docs on top of that that show how to use everything.
    
    Discussion Points:
     
    1) Header Files: I'm distributing this as header only. I did this since it simplified initial distribution (I didn't have
    to get bjam working right away). In house, we build a library. There a lot of things that can be hidden from the user,
    including defining the static instances of the singeltons, if we use a library.
     
    2) Right now we have several different begin/end function pairs in property_group for accessing the different data in
    the system. Is that really the best way to do it? Whould we be passing back const references to the collections instead?
    If we did that, then what dop we do about retrieving a list of all the property names. That is really just keys to a map,
    but we can hide that complexity from the user using the technique we use now.
     
    Dreams:
     
    1) Events: Wouldn't it be cool if you could hook to an event that was fired whenever a specified property value
    changed. Since the system is really just wrapping existing function calls, I haven't come up with a way to do this
    that doesn't add a lot of work to property implementers, and would have high risk of being buggy. Any ideas?
     
    2) Thread Safety: Since the system is really just wrapping existing function calls, any thread safety is tied to
    those function calls. I currently have no way of exposing complex techniques. Any ideas?
