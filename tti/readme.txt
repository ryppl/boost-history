This is the TTI library, which is an abbreviation 
for the Type Traits Introspection library. The TTI 
library allows a programmer to introspect at compile  
time the inner elements of a C++ type. The introspection 
process depends on specifying the name of the inner
element by macros for different types of elements, and 
then using a generated metafunction to determine whether 
that element exists within the enclosing type. The 
inner elements which can be introspected are type, 
class template, member data, member function, static
member data, and static member function.

You can also of course use the Boost newsgroups
