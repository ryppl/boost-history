+ itl_plus_3_2_1 is for users of different platforms that have a version of the
  boost libraries and the build tool bjam installed.
+ You can copy itl_plus/boost/{itl,itl_xt,validate} to the boost directory

Changes
Version 3.2.1. (Boost review version update 2)
+ All source files are now following the boost project conventions
  <prj-root>/boost/itl/...    Header files *.hpp of the library itl
  <prj-root>/libs/itl/...     Examples, Tests, Documentation for itl
+ Added class template interval_bitset for large compressed bitsets.
+ Added itl::insert_iterator itl::add_iterator to fill interval containers from
  stl containers of intervals.  
+ Added element iteration for all interval containers.
+ Set theoretic operations union (+ += | |=), difference (- -=), intersection 
  (& &=) and symmetric difference (^ ^=) are now available as namespace global 
  operators in an infix and an assigning variant for all interval containers and
  many overloads combining elements, segments and useful combinations of 
  different interval containers.
+ Operators for intersection changed from (* *=) to (& &=).
+ Interval constructing functions changed from global function templates to
  static functions.
