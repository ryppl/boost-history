Interval Container Library (Boost.Icl) 4.0.0 Inclusion Version for boost 1.46 
=============================================================================
PLUS 
Icl_xt    Extended by generalized cross tables (cubes) AND
validate  A law based test automaton (LaBatea).

Abstract:
=========

The Boost Interval Container Library (Icl) formerly known 
as Interval Template Library (Itl) provides intervals 
and two kinds of interval containers: Interval_sets and 
interval_maps. Interval_sets and maps can be used just
as the sets or maps of elements. Yet they are much more 
space and time efficient when the elements occur in 
contiguous chunks. This is obviously the case in many 
problem domains, particularly in fields that deal with 
problems related to date and time.

In addition to common set and map semantics, interval
containers allow to compute with segmentation.
A segmentation, e.g. a grid of months, can be intersected
into other interval containers and then be iterated over.

Finally interval_maps allow for aggregations on 
associated values, if added intervals overlap with
intervals, that are stored in the interval_map. This 
feature is called aggregate on overlap.

Icl_xt's cubes and the law based test automaton (LaBatea)
are not yet proposed and prepared as Boost libraries.
But LaBatea has been used in the development of the
icl as test automaton and for checking sematical 
concepts.


NOTE: The core library, Boost.Icl, has been accepted into 
the Boost Library Collection on April 18, 2010. This is 
the library version prepared for inclusion into Boost 1.46.0.

The extended parts icl_xt and validate are not Boost libraries.


Release Notes:
==============

* Boost.Icl 4.0.0 (Inclusion Version for Boost 1.46.0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Tested Compilers: gcc-3.4.4, gcc-4.4.1, 
                    msvc-8.0, msvc-9.0, msvc-10.0.

+ The library has been renamed from
  Interval Template Library (ITL) to
  Interval Container Library (ICL)
  Its namespace is now icl instead of itl.
  
+ Introduction of dynamically bounded and statically bounded intervals
  - The 'universal' interval class itl::interval has been replaced by
  - dynamically bounded discrete_interval and continuous_interval
  - statically bounded right_open_interval, left_open_interval
    icl::closed_interval and icl::open_interval and a uniform set of
    namespace global functions or interval_concept for them.
  - Added functions 'distance' and 'inner_complement' for intervals.
    
+ User defined interval types are now customizable
  - A interval_trait and dynamic_interval_trait template describes
    the generic properties of the interval concept ...
  - and allows to customize the icl library for user defined interval 
    types.

+ Extraction of namespace global functions.
  - Member functions have been extracted form class templates as long
    as they are not needed to maintain type invariants.
  - The sets of namespace global functions build concepts
    icl::element_set, icl::element_map, 
    icl::interval_set, icl::interval_map
  - Functions have been renamed to conform existing standards
    (ISO/OGC).
  - std::set and other stl conformant set types are models of the
    icl's element_set concept. Class template icl::set has been 
    removed.
  - Member functions for element iterations are extracted from
    the class templates.
	
+ Names, refered to as 'colorful terminology' have been renamed
  - neutron -> identity_element
  - unon -> unit_element
  - ... and also their occurrence in composite identifiers

------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Tested Compilers: gcc-3.4.4, gcc-4.3.2, gcc-4.4.1, 
                    msvc-8.0, msvc-9.0, msvc-10.0.
+ Some additions and corrections of the documentation.
+ Added file impl_config.hpp and a macro ITL_IMPL_SPACE that allows to

+ Addition of itl::insert_iterator and itl::add_iterator that allow to 
  copy or transform std::containers of intervals or segments into 
  interval containers.
+ Addition of element_iterators that enable an iteration on the level
  of elements. This allows to execute std::algorithms on interval 
  containers of discrete domain types.

  std_copy that demonstrates the use of itl insert and add iterators
+ Adding a more complex example project "large_bitset" that implement
  large compressed bitsets class template using interval_map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Addition of a class template interval_bitset that implements a 
  large compressed bitset using an interval_map.

  documentation.

* Boost.Validate 3.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Addition of a law 'AtomicEquivalence' to validate the equivalence of
  std::algorithms on element and interval containers.
+ Addition of law based tests validating itl::insert and add iterators
  element_iterators and the implementation of interval_bitset.

========================================================================

+ Documentation of complexity guarantees.
+ Completion of quickbook documentation.
+ LaBatea now measures time per test.

* Boost.Itl 3.0.0 (Preview 4)
------------------------------
+ Tested Compilers: gcc-3.4.4, gcc-4.3.0 and msvc-9.0.
+ Interoperability between interval containers,
  segments and elements.
+ Full operator support for addition, subtraction,
  intersection and symmetric difference.
+ Boost.Quickbook documentation.

icl_plus and boost
==================
						
The interval template library comes in the boost centric project structure
<boost-root>/boost/icl/  contains all include files
<boost-root>/boost/icl/  examples, tests and documentation.
So you can integrate icl, icl_xt and validate into an existing boost 
installation by copying 
boost/{icl,icl_xt,validate} to the <boost-root>/boost directory and
libs/{icl,icl_xt,validate}  to the <boost-root>/libs directory.

In subdirectories like libs/icl/example, libs/icl/test you will find a
Jamfile.v2 that allows you to compile the related code with bjam.

To learn more about boost libraries and bjam refer to the boost web site.
http://www.boost.org/


icl_plus_standalone
===================

You can also download icl_plus_standalone. Included in icl_plus_standalone are
all sources from the boost libraries that are needed to compile icl code, 
examples and tests. For msvc-9 users it contains sln and vcproj files and a few
precompiled libraries needed by examples and test projects. If you are lucky
you can compile and run using

libs/icl/example/vc9_icl_examples.sln            Examples for the icl
libs/icl/test/vc9_icl_tests.sln                  Boost unit tests for the icl
libs/validate/examples/vc9_validate_examples.sln Law based tests for icl
libs/validate/test/vc9_validate_test.sln         Law based tests as unit tests
libs/icl/build/win32/vc9_all.sln                 Almost everything in one project

If this does not work out of the box, you can reinstall the boost date_time and
test binaries using

install_libs.bat

from the command line at the root directory of icl_plus_standalone.
If this still does not work, get a new version of bjam (boost-jam) at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-jam/

and consult documentations at
http://www.boost.org/
