        2011-01-14
        </p>
        <p>
            Version for inclusion into boost 1.46.0 (update 1). Improved portability due to boost night tests 
            on most available compilers and platforms. Improved usability for intervals and interval 
            containers of pointers and boost date_time durations. Bugfixes for interval_bitset and
            addition of some functions and tests. Corrections and improvements of the docu&shy;mentation.

        </p>
        <p>
            Version for inclusion into boost 1.46.0. The library's name was changed to Interval Container Library (ICL).
            Addition of statically bounded intervals. Addition of an interval concept and an interval traits class.
            Made user defined intervals customizable. Extracted member functions to sets of namespace global
            functions that build an interval_set and interval_map concept. Renamed some functions to conform
            existing standards (ISO/OGC) and notions (identity_element, unit_element).

          Implementation of element iterators for all interval containers.
          Implementation of bit iterators for interval bitsets. 
          Added a commented example implementation
          "large bitset" to the quickbook documentation.
          Implementation of large interval_bitset including bit iterators. 
          Added itl::insert_iterator itl::add_iterator to fill interval 
          containers from stl containers of intervals.  
          Implemented boost warning policy.
          Law based tests of element iteration, bit iteration and 
          applicability of stl algorithms 
          (SortedAssociativeContainer properties).

          to improve efficiency.
          Documentation of complexity guarantees.

          The library files are reorganized to comply the boost centric project structure.
          All set theoretic functions are implemented as namspace global operators in an 
          assigning o= and an infix variant. Overloads within and between interval 
          containers and for elements and segments are implemented. Intersection
          operator changed form (*=, *) to (&=, &). 
          The library has been validated for a number of semantic constraints
          using a law based tester. The results of these tests is documented in the
          boost quickbook documentation in section <i>semantics</i>.
          Added a test suite using Boost.Test. Tests for interoperability with
          Boost.Date_Time and Boost.Rational.

        <p>
          Redesign of all interval container class templates according to
          boost standards. Replacing virtual functions by means of static
          polymorphism using the CRT pattern. Adding the self minimizing
          interval_map and the separating separate_interval_set. Separation
          of add/subtract from insert/erase semantics. Starting to develop
          the law based tester and performing law based tests.
          Improvement of the doxygen generated documentation. Improved
          and new examples that use boost code particularly boost date and
          time classes.

          This version is refactored from the initial version for some basic 
          boost standards, like naming conventions, third library
          dependencies and basic portability. This version has been used for
          the first proposal on the boost developers list.
          Improving doxygen generated documentation and examples.

        <p>
          Initial version. Refactored version of the code released as open source by Cortex Software GmbH in 2006.
          Removed some dangling dependencies. Added initial doxygen generated documentation and some examples.

        <p>&ldquo;This can be a really useful class of data structures. 
         I sup&shy;port continued work on getting this into Boost.&rdquo;<br>

        &ldquo;So I love ICL &mdash; it really solved the visualization problem I was
        having. [...] Visualizing that amount of data, in real time, is quite a challenge. I'm
        using ICL to track pre-rendered regions of this time series data. It
        does exactly what I want.&rdquo;

        <p>
        My experience with this use&shy;case 
        [...] did speak toward the richness of the interface. Each time we wanted to apply 
        a dif&shy;ferent operation or extract a different view of the data we found that the scenario
        had already been considered and a solution was readily available.
