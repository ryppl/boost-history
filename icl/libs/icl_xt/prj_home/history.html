		<h2>Revision History</h2>
		
		<p><b>
		icl-4.0.0
		</b> 
		2010-11-04
		</p>
		<p>
			Version for inclusion into boost 1.46.0. The library's name was changed to Interval Container Library (ICL).
			Addition of statically bounded intervals. Addition of an interval concept and an interval traits class.
			Made user defined intervals customizable. Extracted member functions to sets of namespace global
			functions that build an interval_set and interval_map concept. Renamed some functions to conform
			existing standards (ISO/OGC) and notions (identity_element, unit_element). 
		</p>
		
		<p><b>
		itl-3.2.1
		</b>	
		2010-01-16
		</p>
		<p>
			Addition of doxygen generated documentation for extended library parts. 
			Basic documentation and example for law based testing. 
		</p>

		itl-3.2.0
		</b>	
		2009-12-08
		</p>
		<p>
		  <!-- b>Review Version, update 1:</b -->
		  Implementation of element iterators for all interval containers.
		  Implementation of bit iterators for interval bitsets. 
		  Added a commented example implementation
		  "large bitset" to the quickbook documentation.
		  Implementation of large interval_bitset including bit iterators. 
		  Added itl::insert_iterator itl::add_iterator to fill interval 
		  containers from stl containers of intervals.  
		  Implemented boost warning policy.
		  Law based tests of element iteration, bit iteration and 
		  applicability of stl algorithms 
		  (SortedAssociativeContainer properties).
		</p>
				
		<p><b>
		itl-3.1.0
		</b>	
	    2009-09-18
		</p>
		<p>
		  <!-- b>Review Version:</b -->
		  Algorithms are being refactored
		  to improve efficiency.
		  Documentation of complexity guarantees.
		  Completion of quickbook documentation.
		  Added time measurement to law based tests.
		  Addition of law based tests to test suites.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>
		itl-3.0.0
		</b>	
	    2009-03-04
		</p>
		<p>
		  <!-- b>BoostCon09 version:</b -->
		  The library files are reorganized to comply the boost centric project structure.
		  All set theoretic functions are implemented as namspace global operators in an 
		  assigning o= and an infix variant. Overloads within and between interval 
		  containers and for elements and segments are implemented. Intersection
		  operator changed form (*=, *) to (&=, &). 
		  The library has been validated for a number of semantic constraints
		  using a law based tester. The results of these tests is documented in the
		  boost quickbook documentation in section <i>semantics</i>.
		  Added a test suite using Boost.Test. Tests for interoperability with
		  Boost.Date_Time and Boost.Rational.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>
		itl-2.0.1
		</b>	
	    2008-07-28
		</p>
		<p>
		  Redesign of all interval container class templates according to
		  boost standards. Replacing virtual functions by means of static
		  polymorphism using the CRT pattern. Adding the self minimizing
		  interval_map and the separating separate_interval_set. Separation
		  of add/subtract from insert/erase semantics. Starting to develop
		  the law based tester and performing law based tests.
		  Improvement of the doxygen generated documentation. Improved
		  and new examples that use boost code particularly boost date and
		  time classes.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>
		itl-2.0.0
		</b>	
	    2008-05-11
		</p>
		<p>
		  This version is refactored from the initial version for some basic 
		  boost standards, like naming conventions, third library
		  dependencies and basic portability. This version has been used for
		  the first proposal on the boost developers list.
		  Improving doxygen generated documentation and examples.
		</p>

		<p><b>
		itl-1.0.0
		</b>	
		2007-05-17
		</p>
		<p>
		  Initial version. Refactored version of the code released as open source by Cortex Software GmbH in 2006.
		  Removed some dangling dependencies. Added initial doxygen generated documentation and some examples.

		&ldquo;So I love ICL &mdash; it really solved the visualization problem I was
		having. [...] Visualizing that amount of data, in real time, is quite a challenge. I'm
		using ICL to track pre-rendered regions of this time series data. It
		does exactly what I want.&rdquo;

		My experience with this use-case 
		[...] did speak toward the richness of the interface. Each time we wanted to apply 
		a different operation or extract a different view of the data we found that the scenario
		had already been considered and a solution was readily available.
