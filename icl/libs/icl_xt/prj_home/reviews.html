		<p>The application was a digital video/event recording system. [&#8230;]
		Separate ICL containers were used to capture "activity" for each video 
		stream and event source. As a result, the intersection of various events 
		with video for a specific time span was easily extracted. The library 
		was also used to extract monthly, daily, and hourly "visuals" of recorded data.</p>
		
		<p>[&#8230;] In addition to the above use-case I have two other applications that
		I am eager to apply the library to. I have found that the concept of an
		interval container shows up in many of my client's domains.
		</p>
		
		<p>&mdash; <em>What is your evaluation of the documentation?</em><br>

		Excellent! The documentation was enough to get me going and be 
		successful with the library. I found the tutorials and examples 
		very useful and they provide "food for thought" on implementing 
		various patterns.<p>

		<p>&mdash; <em>What is your evaluation of the potential usefulness of the library?</em><br>

		I have found the library to be very useful and intend to use it on more projects 
		in the very near future.

		<p>At the outset, I want to say that I enthusiastically support the
		inclusion of this library in Boost. I also encourage others without a
		specific application in mind to check out the library, as there are a
		lot of fun examples that you might later find useful in other coding
		projects.
		
		[&#8230;] I develop combined hardware and software systems for
		recording from high-throughput neural systems. One of the primary
		challenges we face with such systems is the aggressive demands that 10
		GB/hour of time-series data places on a typical workstation when you
		want to visualize it [&#8230;] ICL solved this problem for me, in a way 
		that honestly freed me from having to think about a lot of the unsavory 
		low-level details.
		</p>
		
		<p>&mdash; <em>What is your evaluation of the potential usefulness of the library?</em><br>
		For my applications, it was crucial -- they would have been far less
		optimal (both from a software-engineering and asymptotic perspective)
		without ICL.

		<p>This is my review of the Interval Container Library (ICL). YES, I vote +1, 
		this library should be accepted into Boost. It is very very useful. During 
		my review my enthusiasm was only growing. Even if there was a thing confusing 
		on the operators (for me). Yes, I can use this library in real life and it will 
		solve problems for me. [&#8230;]

		<p>&ldquo;This can be a really useful class of data structures.

		&ldquo;So I love ICL &mdash; it really solved the visualization problem I was
		having. [...] Visualizing that amount of data, in real time, is quite a challenge. I'm
		using ICL to track pre-rendered regions of this time series data. It
		does exactly what I want.&rdquo;

		<p>
		My experience with this use&shy;case 
		[...] did speak toward the richness of the interface. Each time we wanted to apply 
		a dif&shy;ferent operation or extract a different view of the data we found that the scenario
		had already been considered and a solution was readily available.
