[section:scheduling Scheduling]

The scheduling policy determines how __tasks__ are scheduled inside the __channel__.


[heading fifo]

First inserted pending __task__ gets taken first.


[heading priority]

Each __task__ is submitted to the pool with a priority attribute. The type and ordering of the priority is user-defined.

``
	boost::task::static_pool<
		boost::task::unbounded_channel<		// allow unlimited tasks to be queue in global-queue
			boost::task::priority< int > >	// tasks with lower priority are scheduled first
	> pool( boost::task::poolsize( 5) );

	boost::task::async(
		pool,					// thread-pool
		boost::task::make_task( some_fn),	// task to be executed
		5);					// priority is 5

	boost::task::async(
		pool,					// thread-pool
		boost::task::make_task( another_fn),	// task to be executed
		3);					// priority is 3
``

In this example the __tasks__ get scheduled by the assigned integer (third argument of __fn_async__). The __task__ with the lowest priority
gets scheduled first (taken by a __worker_thread__). The ordering can be changed by the second argument of __priority__ (the default is `std::less< Attr >`).

``
	boost::task::static_pool<
		boost::task::unbounded_channel<
			boost::task::priority< int, std::greater< int > > >	// tasks with higher priority are scheduled first

	> pool( boost::task::poolsize( 5) );
``


[heading smart]

Each inserted __task__ is associated with an attribute. The scheduler gets an put- and take-policy
as template arguments. The corresponding policy gets applied for each insertion and removal.

__boost_task__ provides __replace_oldest__ as put- policy and __take_oldest__ as take-policy. 
Both policies allow the replacement of older (pending) __tasks__ in the scheduler by new ones.

    // creates a pool with unbounded channel
    // tasks are processed depending on the associated attributed
    // oldest tasks with the same attributed pending in the channel
    // will be replaced by the new task
    // this example would execute add( 1, 2) and add( 5, 6)
    // add( 2, 3) is removed (if pending when add( 5, 6) is submitted)

``
	long fibonacci_fn( long n)
	{
		if ( n == 0) return 0;
		if ( n == 1) return 1;
		long k1( 1), k2( 0);
		for ( int i( 2); i <= n; ++i)
		{
			long tmp( k1);
			k1 = k1 + k2;
			k2 = tmp;
		}
		return k1;
	}

	typedef boost::task::static_pool<
		boost::task::unbounded_channel<
			boost::task::smart<
				int,
				std::less< int >,
				boost::task::replace_oldest,
				boost::task::take_oldest
			>
		>
	> pool_type;

	void main()
	{
		pool_type pool( boost::task::poolsize( 1) );

		...

		// replaced by later task with same attribute == 2
		// if still pending in pool
		boost::task::async(
			pool,
			boost::task::make_task( fibonacci_fn, 10),
			2);	// attribute is 2

		// will replace previous pending task with attribute == 2
		boost::task::async(
			pool,
			boost::task::make_task( fibonacci_fn, 5),
			2);	// attribute is 2 too
	}
