[section:utilities Utilities]

__boost_task__ provides some free-functions which can be used inside a __task__ to access some informations (like if the __task__ 
runs in a __thread_pool__).


[heading reschedule_until]

In the function `boost::this_task::reschedule_until( Pred const&)` allows to synchronize the task with other asynchronous events
without blocking the __worker_threads__ (bool Pred::operator()() must not block). The current task will be rescheduled until the
passed predicate becomes true.


[heading get_pool]

The pool in which the current code (__task__) is executed can be accessed via __fn_get_pool__. If hte code is not executed by a
__worker_thread__ an assertion is raised.


[heading runs_in_pool]

In order to check if the current code is executed in a __thread_pool__ __fn_runs_in_pool__ should be used.


[heading worker_id]

__fn_worker_id__ returns the __thread_id__ of the __worker_thread__ executing the current __task__.


[heading delay]

The execution of a __task__ can be delayed for a time-duration or until a specific time-point with __fn_delay__.


[heading yield]

If a __task__ detects that it would bould block it can yield itself with __fn_yield__ so that the __worker_thread__ can execute
another __task__ in the meantime.


[heading interrupt]

A __task__ can interrupt itself via __fn_tt_interrupt__.
