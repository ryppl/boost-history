[section:overview Overview]

__boost_task__ provides an framework for parallel execution of tasks (a task is a small unit of code that can be executed independently).

* __task__, __callable__ representing a fine-grained work-item:
	* __fn_get_id__ returning an identifier
	* __fn_operator__ to execute the fine-grained work-item
	* __fn_get_future__ providing an __act__ in order to pass the result (values, exceptions) back to initiator

* __handle__, __act__ of the asynchronously executed task:
	* __fn_get_id__ for identifying associated __task__
	* __fn_interrupt__, interrupt_and_wait() allow to cancel an coop_task_link[cooperative task]
	* interface of __act__:
		* __fn_get__ retrieve value or exception of task execution
		* __fn_is_ready__ test if task was executed
		* __fn_wait__, wait_for() and wait_until() block until task is executed and the result is set

* __async__, executes a task on behalf of __aes__

* __ae__ models:
	* __own_thread__: executes task in current thread.
	* __new_thread__: executes task in a newly created thread (thread will be destroyed after)
	* __default_pool__: task gets executed by a __worker_thread__ of the default __thread_pool__
	* __as_sub_task__: executes task in newly created thread or in a pool of __worker_threads__ depending on whether current task is already executed in a pool
	* custom pool: task gets executed by a __worker_thread__ of a custom __thread_pool__

[note __boost_task__ uses __boost_future__ from Anthony Williams (will be integrated in some of the next releases of __boost__thread__).]

In order to use the classes and functions described here, you can either include the specific headers specified by the descriptions of each class or function,
or include the master library header:

    #include <boost/task.hpp>

which includes all the other headers in turn.


[heading Tested Platforms]
__boost_task__ has been tested on the following platforms and compilers:

*  Debian GNU/Linux 2.6.29.2 (x86_64), GCC 4.3.3
*  Ubuntu GNU/Linux 2.6.28.11 (x86), GCC 4.3.3
*  FreeBSD 7.2 (x86), GCC 4.2.1 (requires static boost libs for tests)
*  OpenSolaris 0811 (x86_64), SunCC 5.10
*  Windows XP Professional (x86), MSVC 9.0


[heading How to build]
* define environment variable BOOST_BUILD_PATH pointing to the source directory of __boost__
* extract archive of __boost_task__
* call bjam in the directory of __boost_task__
