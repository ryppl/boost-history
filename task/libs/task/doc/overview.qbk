[section:overview Overview]

__boost_task__ provides an framework for parallel execution of tasks (a task is a small unit of code that can be executed independently).

* __task__, __callable__ representing a fine-grained work-item:
	* __fn_get_id__ returning an identifier
	* __fn_operator__ to execute the fine-grained work-item
	* __fn_get_future__ providing an __act__ in order to pass the result (values, exceptions) back to initiator

* __handle__, __act__ of the asynchronously executed task:
	* __fn_get_id__ for identifying associated task
	* __fn_interrupt__, interrupt_and_wait() allow to cancel an cooperative task
	* interface of __act__:
		* __fn_get__ retrieve value or exception of task execution
		* __fn_is_ready__ test if task was executed
		* __fn_wait__, __fn_wait_for__ and __fn_wait_until__ block until task is executed and the result is set
	* __fn_get_future__ returns reference to internal future
	* functions __waitfor_all__/__waitfor_any__ to wait for all or any handles

* __fn_async__, executes a task on behalf of __eps__ asynchronously

* __ep__ models:
	* __own_thread__: executes task in current thread.
	* __new_thread__: executes task in a newly created thread (thread will be destroyed after)
	* __default_pool__: task gets executed by a __worker_thread__ of the default __thread_pool__
	* __as_sub_task__: executes task in newly created thread or in a pool of __worker_threads__ depending on whether current task is already executed in a pool
	* custom pool: task gets executed by a __worker_thread__ of a custom __thread_pool__ (for instance with priority scheduling)

* __thread_pools__ with work-stealing algorithm

* support of forking and joining sub-tasks
	* better performance
	* no deadlock because of inline-execution of sub-tasks
	* automatically detects if code runs in a __thread_pool__ so the appropriate mechanism for executing the sub-tasks is choosen


In order to use the classes and functions described here, you can either include the specific headers specified by the descriptions of each class or function,
or include the master library header:

``
    #include <boost/task.hpp>
``

which includes all the other headers in turn.

Used namespaces are:

``
    namespace boost::task
    namespace boost::this_task
``


[heading Example]

``
	long fibonacci( long n)
	{
		if ( n == 0) return 0;
		if ( n == 1) return 1;
		long k1( 1), k2( 0);
		for ( int i( 2); i <= n; ++i)
		{
			long tmp( k1);
			k1 = k1 + k2;
			k2 = tmp;
		}
		return k1;
	}

	void main()
	{
		boost::task::handle< long > h1(
			boost::task::async(
				boost::task::make_task(
					fibonacci,
					10) ) );
		boost::task::handle< long > h2(
			boost::task::async(
				boost::task::make_task(
					fibonacci,
					5) ) );
		std::cout << "h1: id == " << h1.get_id() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h2: id == " << h2.get_id() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h1: is ready == " << std::boolalpha << h1.is_ready() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h2: is ready == " << std::boolalpha << h2.is_ready() << "\n";
		boost::task::waitfor_all( h1, h2);
		std::cout << "h1: is ready == " << std::boolalpha << h1.is_ready() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h2: is ready == " << std::boolalpha << h2.is_ready() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h1: has value == " << std::boolalpha << h1.has_value() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h2: has value == " << std::boolalpha << h2.has_value() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h1: has exception == " << std::boolalpha << h1.has_exception() << "\n";
		std::cout << "h2: has exception == " << std::boolalpha << h2.has_exception() << "\n";
		std::cout << "fibonacci(10) == " << h1.get() << std::endl;
		std::cout << "fibonacci(5) == " << h2.get() << std::endl;
	}
