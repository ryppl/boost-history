__inherit
If (i) `lhs` of type `LHS` and `rhs` of type `RHS` can be used in expression `lhs/rhs`,
and (ii) `RET=dont_care` or the result of expression `lhs/rhs` is convertible to `RET`
then inherits from __true_type,
otherwise inherits from __false_type.

The default behaviour (`RET=dont_care`) is to not check for the return value of binary `operator/`.
If `RET` is different from the default `dont_care` type, the return value is checked to be convertible to `RET`.
Convertible to `RET` means that the return value of the operator can be used as argument to a function expecting `RET`:
``
void f(RET);
LHS lhs;
RHS rhs;
f(lhs/rhs); // is valid if can_call_division<LHS, RHS, RET>::value==true
``
If `RET=void`, the return type is checked to be exactly `void`.

__examples

[:`can_call_division<LHS, RHS, RET>::value_type` is the type `bool`.]
[:`can_call_division<LHS, RHS, RET>::value` is a `bool` integral constant expression.]
[:`can_call_division<int>::value` is a `bool` integral constant expression that evaluates to `true`.]
[:`can_call_division<long>` inherits from `__true_type`.]

[:`can_call_division<int, int, int>` inherits from `__true_type`.]
[:`can_call_division<int, int, long>` inherits from `__true_type`.]
[:`can_call_division<int, double, double>` inherits from `__true_type`.]
[:`can_call_division<int, double, int>` inherits from `__true_type`.]
[:`can_call_division<const int, int>::value` inherits from `__true_type`.]

[:`can_call_division<int, int, std::string>` inherits from `__false_type`.]


[*Known issues:]

This trait cannot detect whether binary `operator/` is public or not:
if `operator/` is defined as a private member of `LHS` then
instantiating `can_call_division<LHS>` will produce a compiler error.
For this reason `can_call_division` cannot be used to determine whether a type has a public `operator/` or not.
``
struct A { private: void operator/(const A&); };
boost::can_call_division<A>::value; // error: A::operator/(const A&) is private
``

There is an issue if the operator exists only for type `A` and `B` is
convertible to `A`. In this case, the compiler will report an ambiguous overload.
``
struct A { };
void operator/(const A&, const A&);
struct B { operator A(); };
boost::can_call_division<A>::value; // this is fine
boost::can_call_division<B>::value; // error: ambiguous overload
``
