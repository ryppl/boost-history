<h2>Sample 5:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Buffered Channel
With Blocking Active Receiver
</h2>
<br>
A sample shows the usage of buffered channels implemented thru a
synchronous pull dispatcher. In this channel
configuration, messages are buffered inside channel at sender side. The
receiver is active, a thread blocking waiting for the arrival of
messages at synchronous join/choice arbiters and then processing the
messages.<br>
