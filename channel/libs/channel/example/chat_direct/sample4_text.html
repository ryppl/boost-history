<h2>Sample 4: Chat with direct connection</h2>
<br>
This sample shows the usage of hierarchical namespace by defining chat
subjects as string path names. Chat peers directly connect to
each other, subscribing to the subjects they are interested and send
messages with each other. Since it a hierarchical namespace, peers can
subscribe to wildcard ids such as "all sports related subjects".<br>
