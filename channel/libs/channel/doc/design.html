<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId347090"></a><small>1. Introduction</small></h3>
In Unix and most OSes, file systems allow applications to identify,
bind to and operate on system resources and entities (devices,
files,...) using a "name" (path name) in a hierarchical name space
(directory system) which is different&nbsp; from variables and pointers
in flat address space. Many interprocess communication facilities (IPC)
often depend on some kind of "names" to identify them too, such as the
pathname of FIFO or named-pipe, pathname for unix domain socket,
ip-address and port for tcp/udp socket , and keys for System V shared
memory, message queue and semaphores. "The set of possible names for a
given type of IPC is called its <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">name space</span>. The
name space is important because for all forms of IPC other than plain
pipes, the name is how the client and server&nbsp; "connect" to
exchange messages." (quote from W. Richard Stevens "Unix Network
Programming").<br>
<br>
Channel is a C++ template library to provide name spaces for
asynchronous, distributed message passing and event dispatching.
Message senders and receivers bind to names in name space; binding and
matching rules decide which senders will bind to which receivers; then
message passing and event dispatching could happen among bound senders
and receivers.<br>
Channel's signature:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
typename idtype,</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
typename platform_type = boost_platform,</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
typename synchpolicy = mt_synch&lt;platform_type&gt;,</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
typename executor_type = abstract_executor, </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
typename name_space =
linear_name_space&lt;idtype,executor_type,synchpolicy&gt;,</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
typename dispatcher =
broadcast_dispatcher&lt;name_space,platform_type&gt; </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class
channel;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br>
Various name spaces (linear/hierarchical/associative) can be used for
different applications. For example, we can use integer ids as names to
send messages in linear name space, we can use string path name ids <a
 id="intro">(such as
"/sports/basketball")</a> to send
messages in hierarchical name space<a id="intro"> and we can use regex
patterns or
Linda tuple-space style tuples to send messages in associative name
space</a>; User can configure name space
easily
by setting a channel template parameter.<br>
<br>
Channel's other major components are dispatchers; which dispatch
messages/events from senders to bounded receivers. Dispatcher is also a
channel template parameter. The design of dispatchers can vary in
several dimensions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>how msgs move: push or pull; </li>
  <li>how callbacks executed: synchronous or asynchronous. </li>
</ul>
Sample dispatchers includes : synchronous broadcast dispatcher,
buffered asynchronous dispatchers,...<br>
<br>
Name space and dispatchers are orthogonal; they can mix and match
together freely; just as STL algorithms can be used with any STL
containers by means of the iterator range concept, name space and
dispatchers can be used together because of the name binding set
concept. <br>
<br>
By combining different name space and dispatching policies, we can
achieve various models:<br>
<ul>
  <li>synchronous event dispatching&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>associative name space based on matching/look-up rules similar to
Linda tuple space</li>
  <li>asynchronous messaging model similar to Microsoft CCR
(Concurrency Coordination Runtime)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Similar to distributed files systems, distributed channels can be
connected or "mounted" to allow transparent distributed message
passing. Filters and translators are used to control name space changes.<br>
<br>
For tightly coupled single-address-space applications/modules,
Channel's "unnamed" in/out
objects : ports and signal/slots support fine grained and local message
passing model without
the hassle of setting up a name space and assigning names.<br>
<br>
Channel is built on top of Boost facilities: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Boost::shared_ptr for message/event data life-time management</li>
  <li>Boost.Bind, Boost.Function for callback</li>
  <li>Boost.Thread for synchronization</li>
  <li>Boost.Serialization for message marshaling/demarshaling</li>
  <li>Boost.Regex and Boost.Tuple for associative name-matching<br>
  </li>
  <li><big><small>Boost.Asio and Boost.Shmem are used to build
transports among remote channels.</small></big></li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId587884"></a>2. Build</h3>
Channel is continuously being developed and tested in linux
(ubuntu8.04/g++4.2.4 - ubuntu9.04/g++4.3.3) and Windows (Visual C++ 2005 -
Visual C++ 2008). The
implementation is solely based on standard boost facilities plus
Boost.Asio and
Boost.Interprocess. <br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId174795"></a>3. Tutorials</h3>
<p>the following are a few samples showing how different name spaces
and dispatchers can be used in various situations:</p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId270435"></a>3.1 gui event handling</h4>
<p>A simple sample shows that a gui window send (broadcast) simple
events to callbacks (either free functions or object members).
<a href="../example/gui_evt/sample1_text.html">details...</a></p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId147115"></a>3.2 gui event handling with 2 local
channels</h4>
<p>This sample shows how 2 channels can be connected to allow gui
events propagate from one channel to another. Also we use a POD struct
as message id/name.&nbsp; <a
 href="../example/gui_evt/sample2_text.html">details...</a></p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId280170"></a>3.3 distributed gui events</h4>
<p>A sample shows how events can be sent (broadcast) to callbacks in
remote process by connecting local channel to remote channels thru
Boost.Asio. <a href="../example/dist_evt_chan/sample3_text.html">details...</a></p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId886481"></a>3.4 chat with direct connection</h4>
<p>This sample shows the usage of hierarchical name space by defining
chat subjects as string path names. For demo, chat peers directly
connect to each other, subscribing to the subjects they are
interested and send messages with each other. Since it a hierarchical
name space, peers can subscribe to wildcard ids such as "all
sports related subjects". <a
 href="../example/chat_direct/sample4_text.html">details...</a></p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId680978"></a>3.5 buffered channel with blocking
active receiver (synchronous choice, join synchronization patterns)</h4>
<p>A sample shows the usage of buffered channels implemented thru a
synchronous pull dispatcher. In this channel
configuration, messages are buffered inside channel at sender side.
The receiver is active, a thread blocking waiting for the arrival of
messages at synchronous join/choice arbiters and then processing the
messages. <a href="../example/buffered_sync_sendrecv/sample5_text.html">details...</a></p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId232384"></a>3.6 buffered channel with async
receivers (asynchronous choice, join synchronization patterns)</h4>
<p>This sample shows a buffered channel support asynchronous
receivers using asynchronous coordination patterns: choice and join.
The callback actions are dispatched thru a thread pool executor.
<a href="../example/buffered_async_join/sample6_text.html">details...</a></p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId836556"></a><b>3.7 distributed chat thru a
central server</b></h4>
<p>This sample shows simple chat client and server design. Clients
connect to server to chat with each other in seperate chat groups
identified by subject. The chat subject (a string) is the ids in name
space. Clients can join/leave chat groups identified by subject ids
and send messages to chat groups. If the chat group (subject) doesn't
exist yet, the first member's "join" will make it created.
<a href="../example/chat_thru_server/sample7_text.html">details...</a></p>
<a href="sample7_text.html"></a>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId266315"></a>3.8 channel
connection thru shared memory</h4>
This sample shows that remote channels at 2 processes (chat1, chat2)
can be connected thru shared memory message queues based on
Boost.Interprocess. <a href="../example/chat_shmem/sample8_text.html">details...</a><br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId300223"></a>3.9 channel using
regex name matching<br>
</h4>
This sample demos channels using regex pattern matching for
name-matching and message dispatching. Peers can use regex patterns to
bind/subscribe to names/ids. Boost.Regex is used for implementation. <a
 href="../example/chat_regex/sample9_text.html">details...</a><br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId440147"></a>3.10 channel using
Linda-style associative lookup<br>
</h4>
This sample demos channels using Linda-style associative name space.
Tuples are used as names/ids and associative lookup is used for
name-matching. Boost.Tuple is used for implementation. <a
 href="../example/chat_assoc/sample10_text.html">details...</a><br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId505601"></a>3.11 channel name
space management and security with filter and
translator</h4>
<h4></h4>
This sample demos how we can use filters and translators to achieve
name space management and security. <a
 href="../example/filter_translator/sample11_text.html">details...</a><br>
<h4><a name="sample_dispatcher"></a>3.12 port and signal: unnamed point
of tightly-coupled local interactions
</h4>
This tutorial explains 3 samples based on port and signal. <a

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId750399"></a>4. Design</h3>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId135917"></a>4.0 Overall Design
Idea</h4>
"Names" play important role in distributed computing:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Name space plays a central role in plan9/inferno distributed OS
as
described in [1][2]. </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">quote: <br>
"... a new kind of system, organized around communication and naming
..."<br>
"A single paradigm (writing to named places) unifies all kinds of
control and interprocess signaling."<br>
It can be briefly summerized as following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Every resource, either local or remote, is represented as a
hierarchical file system (name space).</li>
  <li>Each process can assemble a private view of the system by
constructing a local/private name space that connect these resources
thru mount, bind and umount on demand.</li>
  <li>The interface to named resources are file-oriented; they are
accessed thru open/close/read/write calls.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Robin Milner[3][4] gives a detailed discussion about what we can
do
with a name in asynchronous message passing, or the interactions thru
"name":</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">The following
operations on names are identified:<br>
<ul>
  <li>use name: call, co-calling (response)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">call -
vocative use of name by one agent</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">co-call/response - reaction by other</span><br>
Synchronized action is the coming together (binding) of calling and
co-calling (thru name).<br>
The reason to distinquish between "calling" and "response" is that, in
describing any agents ( processes/ threads/ ...), we define its
potential
behaviour (or capabilities) by what calls and responses it can make -
this is the basic idea underlying the active objects or communicating
processes based design which will be detailed in later section.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>mention name: quote/co-quote, match<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;">quote, co-quote:</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">quote/co-quote is refering to the way
we can pass names as/inside message content. We can simulate function
call (call-and-return) by packing a "return" name/id inside message and
waiting on this name for result (from remote).<br>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;">match:</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">test a name for equality with another
name. Name matching algorithms are mostly dependent on name space
structure. In following sections, we will expand "matching" to include
wildcards and regex matching<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
The design of Channel is based on the following integration of
Plan9/Inferno's
name space idea and Robin Milner's interaction thru names:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Channel provides process local private name_space which is
customizable thru connecting to other channels.</li>
  <li>The semantics of names are changed; names do not refer to named
resources (which are relatively static entities), but to named "points
of interaction" (which are mostly dynamic); thus file-oriented api and
semantics are dropped and Robin Milner's operations/interactions on
names are adopted as the api: calling/co-calling/matching.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">

<h4><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId540592"></a>4.1 Name space</h4>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId84795"></a>4.1.1 What's in a name?</h4>
In Channel, to facilitate name-matching/binding operations, a name has
the
following attributes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>id_type<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Id is the main content of names.
Various types of ids can be used for different applications: integer,
strings, POD structs etc can be used for linear name space;
string
path names can be used for hierarchical name spaces and regex patterns
and Linda style tuples can be used for associative name space.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>id_trait and id-matching algorithms<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Id_trait defines the attributes of an
id type. A major feature of id_trait is the
id-matching algorithm,
which partially decides name-matching and thus which senders will bind
which receivers and be
able to send messages to them. For example, exact matching can be used
for linear name space ids; prefix matching can be used for path
name ids; while in associative name spaces, regex pattern matching and
Linda style associative lookup can be used for id-matching.<br>

  <li>linear:</li>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId182536"></a>4.1.3 Name binding
set and Name matching
algorithm, binding rules<br>
</h4>
No pure name exist; Names are ONLY created into name space when bound
for sending/receiving msgs:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Named_Out: output/send interface bound with name</li>
  <li>Named_In: input/receiv interface bound with name</li>
</ul>
Name binding sets:<br>
<ul>
  <li>for Named_Out, its binding_set is the set of bound Named_Ins to
which to send messages</li>
  <li>for Named_In, its binding_set is the set of bound Named_Outs from
which to receive messages</li>
</ul>
There are 2 aspects to the name matching algorithms and binding rules
to decide binding_sets:<br>
<ul>
  <li>id matching: the id of Named_Out must "match" the id of Named_In
based on matching operation defined in id_trait<br>
  </li>
  <li>scope &amp; membership matching: the membership and scope of both
Named_Out and Named_In must match. This doesn't mean they must be the
same. For example, a local sender&nbsp; (MEMBER_LOCAL) with SCOPE_LOCAL
can bind to receivers with &lt;MEMBER_LOCAL, SCOPE_LOCAL&gt; or
&lt;MEMBER_LOCAL, SCOPE_GLOBAL&gt;. There is an internal table
recording
all such valid combinations.</li>
</ul>
Named_Out and Named_In don't bind to each other directly (as in most
event dispatching systems). Instead, they bind to names in name
space. Based on binding and matching rules, their binding set will
be resolved which will contain the direct pointers to their
counterpart. Actual message passing and dispatching happen on the
binding set; never need to go thru name space again. So the actual
message passing and dispatching behaviour and performance should be the
same as&nbsp; we&nbsp; have registered the Named_In directly with
Named_Out ( as we would have done in normal event dispatching systems ).<br>
Based on name-matching, there are possibly the following 4 kinds of
binding sets:<br>
<ul>
  <li>1 - 1:&nbsp; one named_out binds with exactly one named_in</li>
  <li>1 - N: one named_out binds with a group of named_ins (e.g. when
many subscribers subscribe to the same name)</li>
  <li>N - 1: one named_in binds with a group of named_outs (e.g. when a
subscriber subscribes using a wildcard name or regex pattern, it could
receive from multiple sources)</li>
  <li>N - M: both named_out and named_in bind with a group of
counterparts.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId891206"></a>4.1.4 Name spaces
merge and connections<br>
</h4>
When 2 channels (A &amp; B) are connected/mounted, their name spaces
are
merged as following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>names flowing from B-&gt;A:&nbsp; the intersection of A's set of
Named_In with global/remote scope (global subscriptions) and B's set
of&nbsp; Named_Out with global/remote scope (global
publications) </li>
  <li>names flowing from A-&gt;B:&nbsp; the intersection of B's set of
Named_In with global/remote scope (global subscriptions) and A's set
of&nbsp; Named_Out with global/remote scope (global
publications) </li>
  <li>newly created names/ids are automatically
propogated to connected channels. So peers in channel A can communicate
with peers in channel B transparently the same way as with the local
peers. </li>
</ul>
Filter, translator can be specified at connections among channels to
control name space merge:<br>
<ul>
  <li>filter: decide which ids are allowed to be exported/sent to
(visible at) remote
channels and which remote ids are allowed be imported to local name
space<br>
  </li>
  <li>translator: allow translation of ids imported to local name space
and ids exported to remote name space; so we can relocate the imported
remote name space ids to a specific subspace in the local name space,
similar to the way that in distributed file systems, a remote file
system can be mounted to a specific point in local file system.</li>
</ul>
Based on applications name space management requirements, we may need
to "relocate"/"mount" the names imported (from a connection to a remote
name space) to a specific sub-region in name space. For example, if we
have a name space in desktop computer and connect to a PDA and a
laptop, we can set translators at connections so that names imported
from PDA will appear under "/pda/" and names from laptop will appear
under "/laptop/". Or if our application use integer as ids/names, we
may want to relocate ids from the 1st connection to [1000-1999] and ids
from next connection to [2000-2999] and so on. That is similar to the
way how we mount remote file-systems to local file-system.<br>
Based on security requirements, we may need to use filters to restrict
the valid range of names allowed to pass in/out specific channel
connections. For example, a server's name space connect to 2 clients
and we want that these clients' name spaces and messaging are totally
separate, so that one client is unware of anything happening inside the
other client's name space such as new name-publications and message
passing. That is also similar to the way we protect network by
firewalls and NATs.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId210395"></a>4.2 Dispatching</h4>
Dispatchers or dispatching policies are operations or algorithms
defined over name binding set. They define the semantics of
"interactions
thru names". Based on RobinMilner's separation of
calling and co-calling, there are 2 parts defined for each
dispatching algorithm:<br>
<ul>
  <li>sending (or sender) algorithm: corresponding to calling<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>defined over the set of bound Named_In (receiver) objects</li>
    <li>may contain message buffering mechanism inside channel
(Named_Outs)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>receiving (or receiver) algorithm: corresponding to co-calling<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>defined over the set of bound Named_Out (sender) objects</li>
    <li>may support high level messaging coordination patterns (such as
Choice and Join)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
The following are major design considerations for dispatchers.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId862080"></a>4.2.1 How message
data move: push/pull, buffering</h4>
There are 2 basic models of passing messages/events from senders to
receivers:<br>
<ul>
  <li>push model: message data are pushed by senders to receivers</li>
  <li>pull model: message data are pulled by receivers from senders</li>
</ul>
Since Channel is for asynchronous messaging, mostly the following 2
dispatching categories are used:<br>
<ul>
  <li>push:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Dispatching variations can be:
broadcast, round-robin,...<br>
Execution variations can be: <br>
<ul>
  <li>synchronous: the sending threads will push messages all the way
to
receviers and invoke receiving callbacks directly</li>
  <li>asynchronous: the sending threads will push messages to receivers
and dispatch the receiving callbacks to some executors for later
executions<br>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>buffering+pull:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Messages are buffered inside channel at
Named_Out side; receivers pull message data in two ways:<br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>sync/blocking receiver: in this model, receivers are active
receiving threads block-waiting at Named_In, unblocked when message
data are
available and pull data from Named_Out</li>
  <li>async receiver: async callback operations are registered to
logical conditions of message arrivals (choice and join) and will be
dispatched to executors depending on message arrivals.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Message coordination patterns (choice
and join) are applied for both pull synchronous and asynchronous model
to
decide when a synchronous receiving thread can be unblocked or
asynchronous callback can be fired based on the available messages.<br>
<br>
</div>
For message buffering inside channel, we can have various design
choices:<br>
<ul>
  <li>synchronized queues with flow control: low water mark and high
water mark</li>
  <li>timeouts for when messages will expire</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId629360"></a>4.2.2 How operations
are performed: synchronous/asynchronous</h4>
When messages arrive, we have 2 choices for how dispatching operations
and callbacks are performed:<br>
<ul>
  <li>synchronous: the sending thread will carry out dispatching and
callbacks</li>
  <li>asynchronous: dispatching or callbacks will be scheduled in an
executor; and later executed by the executor in a different calling
context or thread</li>
</ul>
There are various designs of executors. [7] provides detailed
discussion about Java's executor design. <br>
Different executors can run threads in different scheduling priorities
and we can assign callbacks to run in propr executors according to
applications' requirements<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId248159"></a>4.2.3 Message passing
coordination
patterns<br>
</h4>
Join-calculus, Comega, and CCR [5][6] define a few messaging
coordination
patterns regarding to when and how messages will be consumed and
callbacks be fired: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Choice: a combo registration of a group of &lt;name,
callback&gt;; whenever any "name" has message delivered, its associated
callback will be fired<br>
  </li>
  <li>Join: a callback is registered with a set of names; when messages
become available on all names, the messages will be taken from all
names "atomically" and the registered callback will be invoked.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
In channel, both choice and join are applied in synchronous and
asynchronous forms.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId995030"></a>4.2.4 Messages
handling</h4>
life-time management of messages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>avoid data copying, pass pointers to messages instead of
duplicating message data</li>
  <li>wrap message data pointer inside boost::shared_ptr so that
message data's life time management is automatic<br>
  </li>
</ul>
marshaling/demarshaling of messages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>use Boost.Serialization for marshaling/demarshaling</li>
  <li>a channel could have multiple remote connections, each of them
could use different transport (tcp/ip, soap, shared-memory) and on-wire
message format
(text/binary/xml). In Channel based applications, a marshaler_registry
can be created for each specific transport type and format.
By registering message data type with a marshaler_registry using ids as
key, internal marshaling/demarshaling functions will be created for the
registered message data types and invoked automatically when messages
are sent-to and received-from remote channels. When a
channel is connected to a remote channel thru "streams", we must
specify
which marshaler_registry to use for marshaling. <br>
  </li>
  <li>for each id/msg-type, we can have different settings of
marshaling:</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>explicitly register a message data type: internally a marshaler
object will be created and registered with ids<br>
  </li>
  <li>use a globally registered default marshaler (if all ids use the
same data structure)</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId967906"></a>4.3 Connection related</h4>
The following are design considerations related to channel connections.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId216417"></a>4.3.1 Connections</h4>
there are 2 kinds of connections:<br>
<ul>
  <li>local connection:&nbsp; inside the same process, we can have
multiple channels for different purposes; we can connect these local
channels to facilitate the communication among their peers.<br>
  </li>
  <li>remote connection: we can connect channel to a remote channel
inside a different process or different machines; the remote interface
is represented as "streams": socket stream, pipe, or a message queue
inside shared memory;</li>
</ul>
connection object is a simple object, just containing the two
peers/ends of the connection.<br>
ways to break a connection:<br>
<ul>
  <li>delete connection object; peers are deleted and channels
disconnect</li>
  <li>one peer channel is destroyed, the connection will be destroyed
automatically and the other channel disconnect</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId162029"></a>4.3.2 Peer</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the common interface for connection peers:
interfaces and streams<br>
<ul>
  <li>interface:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">proxy of peer channel<br>
core of channel connection logic:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;. how remote
binding/unbinding events will effect local name space<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;. how messages are
propagated from and to remote channels<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>stream:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Stream is used to wrap a remote
transport connection (socket, pipe or message queue inside shared
memory).<br>
In earlier implementation of Channel on ACE[8], a Connector class is
included as one of the core classes; which will connect local and
remote channels. the disadvantage of this design is that Channel is
tied to a specific architecture (such as thread per connection); making
it difficult to integrate channel with other existing servers.<br>
In plan9/inferno, when we mount a remote name space to local, the real
function is to mount a descriptor (file, pipe, or socket connection) to
a specific point in name space.<br>
Following this style, remote channel connection is to connect/mount a
"stream" to a local channel/name_space; the stream wraps a socket,
pipe, or shared_memory message
queue connecting a remote channel in another process or machine. thus
avoid interfering with servers' internal design: such as
threading; so that channel can work well with both single-thread async
and multi-thread sync server design.<br>
</div>
<h4><a name="unnamed_design"></a>4.4 "Unnamed" binding of output/input
or points of tightly-coupled
local
interactions</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed in the "Overall Design Idea" section,
message passing happens on the binding of calling(the sender of
dispatcher) and co-calling(the receiver of dispatcher).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the above discussions focus on setting up this
binding thru name-matching in name spaces. "Binding thru names"
provides a loosely coupled computing model. A agent or thread can
perform or provide its functionality thru the "names" which it
publishes and subscribs in application channel. It can be moved to
another process or another machine and continue functioning as before
as long as in its new enviroment there is a channel connected to the
original channel and the moved agent attaches to the new channel with
the same set of "names". However sometimes it may be too much
burden/overhead than benefit to set up a name space and assign proper
names, if all we want is performing "localized" computation based on
message passing model.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many message passing based
systems,
threads(or
processes in CSP meaning) communicate thru "ports" or
"channels" which are normal local objects with possible internal
message queue.
Choice/Join arbiters work directly with these local objects. Pointers
to these objects can be passed inside messages to enable various
message-passing based idioms. These provide a tightly coupled localized
models inside the same address space.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From channel's design perspective, these localized
communication primitives can be encoded as special kinds of binding set
of senders (named_out) and
receivers (named_in). They are "unnamed", not set up thru name matching
in name space. For example in C++CSP, there are One2OneChannel,
Any2OneChannel and One2AnyChannel. One2OneChannel can be encoded as the
binding of one "unnamed_out" and one "unnamed_in"; Any2OneChannel can
be encoded as the binding of a group of "unnamed_out" and a single
"unnamed_in"; One2AnyChannel can be encoded as the binding of a single
"unnamed_out" and a group of "unnamed_in" (please note that CSP
requires synchronous rendezvous of sender and recevier which can be
implemented thru a
special dispatcher). There is a similar case with normal event
dispatching systems
where application code directly attaches event receivers (slots) to
event sources (signals), not thru name-matching in name space.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Channel provides generic functions to set up
and break binding among any pair of named_out and named_in:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
template &lt;typename name&gt; void bind(name *named_out, name
*named_in);</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;typename name&gt; void unbind(name
*named_out, name *named_in);</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By means of these functions, we can setup any
imaginable bindings (1-N, N-1, N-M) among named_out and named_in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various message passing systems use different idioms
or patterns of binding sets. Channel provides the following
sample tightly coupled idioms thru "unnamed" in/out objects (<a
 href="../../../boost/channel/unnamed_in_out.hpp">unnamed_in_out.hpp</a>):
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Ports are objects with internal message buffering. Applications
can
send messages thru ports. Choice/Join arbiters coordinate how messages
are consumed from ports and how handlers are called. (similar to CCR's
ports)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Signals and Slots objects provide direct support for "localized"
event dispatching. Slots objects identify the bindings between&nbsp;
event source (signal) and callbacks; Deletion of either signal or slots
will remove these bindings automatically.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ports and Signals are simple template specialization
of
Named_Out and Named_Ins with null_id (unnamed!) and proper dispatchers
(pull dispatcher for Port and push dispatcher for Signal/Slot). They
can be customized by template parameters just as normal
channel entities, e.g. Port can be customized with different queue
types and Signal/Slot can be customized with different dispatching
algorithms (broadcast, round-robin ...). Ports and Signals are well
integrated with "named" entities:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Ports can participate in the same Choice/Join arbiter as
"ids/names"; so arbiters can coordinate both local and remote messages.
Some important usage of this is to implement the timeout or exception
exit of Choice/Join. A timer generate events into a timeout port which
can be included in a Choice. Choice could receive timeout message and
exit when it happens.</li>
  <li>Ports and Signals can later be attached to names in name space;
so they become normal "named" entities and can enjoy binding thru
name-matching and remote message passing as usual.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId970853"></a>4.5 Application
architecture and integration</h4>
Channel is intentionally designed to be indepedent of threading models
and connection strategies. So channel can be helpful to implement
various applications with different designs of threading and connection:<br>
<ul>
  <li>event dispatching/callbacks based applications: such as GUI
frameworks where there is no explicit mentioning of thread (single
threaded)</li>
  <li>asynchronous I/O based server applications: such as servers based
on Boot.Asio, eventlib or libasync; in these kind of servers, there may
be single or a few "main" threads driving the reactive or proactive
main event loop; all threads play equal role.</li>
  <li>active objects or communicating processes based design: this is
the original target applications of Channel; they are popular in large
scale distributed embedded systems design. In these designs, the whole
system is partitioned into many interacting processes/threads; each of
which performs a specific functionality (defined mostly by its
publishing/sending names-set and subscribing/receiving names-set),
maintains/own a part of system
state (finite state machines) and interacting with each other ONLY thru
message passing. No one can directly change the system state owned by
another process/thread; Change requests can only be sent to owner
process/thread as messages and owner can reasonably reject them.</li>
  <li>thread pool based server design: In these systems, servers' job
can be partitioned into scheduling units - tasks, which are dispatched
to a dedicated pool of threads for execution. There are two kind of
threads in system: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>master threads: listening for incoming client requests and
dispatch tasks to pool</li>
    <li>worker threads: member of pool, waiting for tasks and execute
them</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Channel's independence of threading and connection also makes it easy
to integrate Channel with exising server applications of various
designs. Basically we'll write wrapper classes to glue channel to
existing server mechanisms:<br>
<ul>
  <li>"executors" wrappers to integrate channel's asynchronous
operations execution into servers' threading model</li>
  <li>"streams" wrappers to implement remote channel connection thru
server existing connection strategies<br>
  </li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major purpose of name space is to set up the
bindings among named_outs and named_ins based on id-matching and

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId828224"></a> 5.1.2 id_type and
id_trait </h4>
As described above, various id_types (integer, string, PODS, pathnames,
tuples etc) can be used for different applications and name spaces. To
support
name binding operations, id_type should support the following
operations:<br>
<ul>
  <li>id_types used for linear name space support operator&lt;() for
linear "ordering" among ids</li>
  <li>id_types used for hierarchical name space support "containment"
operation to decide among 2 ids which will contain the other</li>
  <li>all id_type should define "match" operation in its id_trait
classes:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>For ids in linear name space, we define exact match in <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/name_spaces/linear_id_trait.hpp">linear_id_trait</a><br>
    </li>
    <li>For ids in hierarchical name space, we define prefix match in <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/name_spaces/hierarchical_id_trait.hpp">hierarchical_id_trait</a>
(ie.
"/sports/*" will match both "/sports/basketball" and
"/sport/baseball")&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>For ids in associative name space, ids will be either regex or
tuples
containing
multiple fields; for regex ids, regex pattern matching is used; for
tuple ids, 2 ids will match if all their fields match or some
fields are wildcards. regex ids and tuple ids are defined in <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/name_spaces/assoc_id_trait.hpp">assoc_id_trait</a>.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
To be able to use primitive data types as name space ids, containment
and matching operations are defined inside id_trait classes.<br>
For channels to be connected with remote name spaces, non-primitive
id_type should define serialize() methods to allow ids be marshaled and
demarshaled using Boost.Serialization.<br>
Id_trait classes also contain definitions of the following 8 system ids:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type channel_conn_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type channel_disconn_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type
init_subscription_info_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type connection_ready_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type subscription_info_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type unsubscription_info_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type publication_info_msg;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static id_type unpublication_info_msg.<br>
These ids are used internally for channel name space management.
Applications can also subscribe to these system ids to receive
notifications about name space changes and add application logic to
react properly; for example:<br>
<ul>
  <li>start communication when remote channels connect in or remote
peers join
in.<br>
  </li>
  <li>perform special handlings when channel disconnect.<br>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId856863"></a>5.1.3 name and name
binding callback</h4>
Class <a href="../../../boost/channel/name.hpp">name</a>
is an internal class; application code will not use names
directly however. Applications will instantiate <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/named_in_out.hpp">named_out
and named_in</a> to set up message passing logic.<br>
Class <a href="../../../boost/channel/name.hpp">name</a>
contains the most important information in name space: id,
scope, membership and binding_set.<br>
When Named_In and Named_Out are instantiated, a name binding callback
can be specified to allow applications to be notify when peers bind
to the name. Its signature :<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">void binding_callback(name *n,
typename name::binding_event e).</span><br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId915384"></a>5.1.4 named_out and
named_in; publisher and subscriber</h4>
Class <a href="../../../boost/channel/named_in_out.hpp">named_out
and named_in</a> are where name space and dispatcher meets.
In fact, they inherit from both class name and dispatcher.<br>
Class <a href="../../../boost/channel/named_in_out.hpp">named_out_bundle
and named_in_bundle</a> are helper classes to
conveniently use a group of name bindings.<br>
On top of named_out_bundle and named_in_bundle, class <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/pub_sub.hpp">publisher
and
subscriber</a> provide direct support for publish/subscribe model.<br>
<h4><a name="unnamed_class"></a>5.1.5 <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/unnamed_in_out.hpp">unnamed in/out: port
and signal/slot</a></h4>
Class port provides direct support for localized tightly coupled
message passing model. Port inherit pull_dispatcher's sender which
inherit queue class. So port can be used directly as a message queue
and application can put messages into it and get messages from it.
However ports are mostly used with choice/join arbiters.<br>
Class signal/slot support localized "unnamed" event dispatching model.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId750531"></a><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/binder.hpp">5.1.6
binder, filter and translator</a></h4>
Filters and translators are defined to control name space changes
during name space connection and binding. Binders contain both filters
and translators and are specified in channel connection function calls.
APIs and dummy operations of binders, filters and translators are
defined <a href="../../../boost/channel/binder.hpp">here,</a><br>

related</h4>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId308124"></a>5.2.1 dispatchers</h4>
As we discussed above, dispatchers have 2 parts: sending and receiving
algorithms.
Dispatcher's API are not fixed, depending on whether it uses push or
pull model and it is synchronous or asynchronous. The following sample
dispatchers are provided:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/push_dispatcher_base.hpp">push
dispatchers</a>:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/broadcast_dispatcher.hpp">broadcast_dispatcher</a>:
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">senders/named_out broadcast
messages/events to all bound receivers/named_in. This is the most
common event dispatching semantics.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/round_robin_dispatcher.hpp">round_robin_dispatcher</a>:&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">senders/named_out send messages/events
to bound receivers/named_in in round-robin manner. Simple server load
balance can be achieved thru this.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/always_1st_dispatcher.hpp">always_latest_dispatcher</a>:</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">senders/named_out always send
messages/events to the latest bound receivers/named_in. This is a
dispatcher to simulate plan9's union directory (though most semantics
is achieved thru nam space binding/connection). Suppose we use an id
(such as "/dev/printer") represent a printer resource. To print
something, we send a message to that id. On another machine there is
another printer bound to the same id in their local channel.&nbsp; To
be able to use the 2nd printer, we could connect or mount the remote
channel to local channel. Then if always_latest_dispatcher is used, all
following printouts (sent to&nbsp; /dev/printer) will come from the
remote printer. The local printer will get
print messages again after the channels disconnect.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/pull_dispatcher_base.hpp">pull
dispatcher</a>:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In pull dispatcher, messages/events are
buffered inside channel at Named_Outs, high level messaging
coordination patterns - "arbiters" are defined at Named_Ins to decide
when and how messages are pulled from Named_Outs and consumed by
receiving threads or callbacks.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/arbiters_sync.hpp">synchronous
arbiters (choice_sync, join_sync)</a>:</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Both senders and
receivers are active threads. Messages are buffered inside channel at
sender/named_out side and sending thread returns right away. Receiving
threads block waiting messages at synchronous arbiters. They unblock
and process messages when messages are
available at named_outs and their associated arbiters fired.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/dispatchers/arbiters_async.hpp">asynchronous
arbiters (choice_async, join_async)</a>:</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Callbacks are registered with
asynchronous arbiters. Messages are buffered inside channel at
sender/named_out
side and sending thread will notify receivers before return. Depending
on arriving messages, asynchronous arbiters will decide which callbacks
will fire; and schedule them to execute in an executor. Join arbiters
will quarantee that
related messages are consumed atomically.<br>
</div>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId187818"></a>5.2.2 messages</h4>
<ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Application message/event data can be
any data type : primitives, structs and classes.&nbsp; For remote
message passing, proper serialization functions must be defined using
Boost.Serialization:<br>
<ul>
  <li>free serialization functions for non-intrusive serialization<br>
  </li>
  <li>message struct and classes can define serialize() methods; and
should
define default construtor for serialization, otherwise
save_construct/load_construct need to be overwritten.</li>
</ul>
Please refer to the tutorials for sample message definitions.<br>
</div>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId953831"></a>5.2.3 queues</h4>
Queues are used for inside channel message buffering. One of pull
dispatcher's template parameter is queue type. Various applications can
specify and use different queue types based on applications'
requirements and queues' capability. Queues will support the following
common interface:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void
put(elem_type &amp; e);</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void
get(elem_type &amp; e);</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The following sample queue implementations are or will be provided:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/queues/unbounded_queue.hpp">unbounded_queue</a>:
a simple synchronized queue with unlimited buffer size, so senders are
never blocked.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/queues/bounded_queue.hpp">bounded_queue</a>:
a synchronized queue bounded with a maximum number of buffered
messages; when queue buffer is full, the senders will be blocked till
some messages are removed from the queue.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/queues/dropping_queue.hpp">dropping_queue</a>:
a synchronized queue bounded with a maximum number of buffered
messages; when queue buffer is full, newly added messages will force
oldest messages to be dropped and senders will never be blocked.<br>
  </li>
  <li>flow_controlled_queue (coming): a flow controlled queue
supporting priority based message enqueue and dequeue; modelled after
ACE's message queue<br>
  </li>
  <li>timed_queue (coming): modelled after JavaSpace's "Lease on
entries" mechanism; for each message inserted into queue, a time-out
value will be specified; the message will be dropped if it is not
consumed by receivers when its time-out expires.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId573559"></a>5.2.4 executors<br>
</h4>
Executors allow us avoid explicitly spawning threads for asynchronous
operations; thus avoiding thread life cycle overhead and resource
consumption. &nbsp; Executors should support the following common
interface to allow application register asynchronous operations to be
executed later and cancel this registration:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
template &lt;typename task_type&gt;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
async_task_base * execute(task_type
task);</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool
cancel(async_task_base *task);</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The following sample executors are provided:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/executors/in_place_executor.hpp">in_place_executor</a>:
just run the asynchronous task in current
thread and current calling context.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/executors/delayed_executor.hpp">delayed_executor</a>:
asynchronous task is queued and calling thread
returns. The queued tasks can be executed later by calling run().<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/executors/asio_executor.hpp">asio_executor</a>:
a wrapper over asio's io_service.post() method.
asynchronous tasks will be dispatched to asio's main thread to execute.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a
 href="../../../boost/channel/executors/thread_pool_executor.hpp">thread_pool_executor</a>:
a dedicated pool of threads executing
submited tasks.</li>
  <li><a href="../../../boost/channel/executors/threadpool_executor.hpp">threadpool_executor</a>:
a wrapper over Philipp Henkel's <a
 href="http://threadpool.sourceforge.net">threadpool</a> library<br>
  </li>
</ul>
There are two places to plugin executors in framework:<br>
<ul>
  <li>channel-wide.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">specifying an executor when channel is
created. By default, all asynchronous operations (event/message
callbacks, name binding callbacks,...) will be scheduled and executed
in this executor.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>where callbacks are bound.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For example, some applications may want
to give different priorities to handling different event ids (or
message types). We can create several
executors with their threads running in different scheduling priority;
and specify proper executors when named_in and named_out are created.<br>

abstraction policy and synchronization policy<br>
</h4>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId345412"></a>5.4.1 platform
abstraction</h4>
Platform independence is one key factor for Channel's portability.
Channel's internal implementation depends on some system facilities,
such as
mutex, condition, timers and logging. Various platforms have different
levels of support and different APIs for these system facilities. Some
boost libraries already provide nice wrappers over system facilities
such as Boost.Thread and Boost.Date_Time. However for some system
functions, boost doesn't have an approved library yet, such as logging.
Class <a href="../../../boost/channel/platforms/boost_platform.hpp">boost_platform</a>
is a platform policy class defined to support platform independence.
All the system facilities Channel uses for internal implementation are
either defined as nested classes wrapped inside it or its static
methods. To port Channel to a different software/hardware platform, one
major work is to reimplement the platform policy class using native
functions (another is coping with compiler difference). Take logging
for example, in future if we have a portable boost library for it, we
could redefine boost_platform class to interface to it. Otherwise for a
Windows specific application, we can implement platform class logging
API using Windows event log facility; for linux based application, we
can use syslog.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId405486"></a>5.4.2 synchronization
policy</h4>
Modeled after ACE's synchronization wrapper facades (ACE_Thread_Mutex,
ACE_Null_Mutex, ACE_Null_Condition,...) and Null Object&nbsp; pattern,
two "no-op" classes null_mutex and null_condition are defined. They
follow the same interface as their counterparts in Boost.Thread and
implement the methods as "no-op" inline functions, which can be
optimized away by compilers. Also modeled after ACE's Synch_Strategy
classes (MT_SYNCH, NULL_SYNCH) and Strategized Locking pattern, two
synchronization policy classes are defined: <a
 href="../../../boost/channel/platforms/synch_policy.hpp">mt_synch and
null_synch</a>. mt_synch is for multithreaded applications which
contains Boost.Thread's mutex/condition classes as nested types.
null_synch is for single-threaded applications whose nested types are
"null" types we mentioned above. synchronization policy class is one of
channel template parameters which we can use either mt_synch for
channel to be used in multithreaded application or use null_synch for
single threaded application (such as event dispatching) without
incurring overhead. The usage is different from the above mentioned
platform independence, it is for application requirement and efficiency.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId283551"></a>6. Class Concepts and
How to extend
Channel framework</h3>
One essential task of Generic Programming is to find the set of
requirements for each class/type so that the template framework can
compile and operate properly. These requirements are called "concepts"
and include the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>valid expressions</li>
  <li>associated types</li>
  <li>invariants</li>
  <li>complexity guarantees</li>
</ul>
To extend Channel framework, new classes / types must satisfy the
requirements of its "concept" so that code can compile and run.<br>
In the following discussions, we classify 2 kinds of requirements:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Primary requirements: must be satisfied for the main framework
design idea<br>

  <li>Secondary requirements: should be satisfied per local

dispatchers follow the general convention of providing various
send() and recv().
<ol>
  <li>Primary requirements</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Each dispatcher class should define 2
nested types:<br>
<ul>
  <li>sender </li>
  <li>recver</li>
</ul>
These nested types are the parent classes of named_in and named_out.<br>
Inside dispatcher nested types (sender and receiver classes),
dispatching algorithms retrieve name binding set from associated "name"
object.<br>
</div>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Secondary requirements</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For dispatchers which are used in
channel types with possible remote connections, the nested receiver
classes will expect the callback function's signature as :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void callback(id_type id,
boost::shared_ptr&lt;void&gt; msg).<br>
This requirement is because of the implementation of "interface" class.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId631535"></a>7. Compare Channel to
others (plan9, STL)</h3>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId547030"></a>7.1 Compare
Unix/Plan9/Inferno file-system name space and Channel's name space</h4>
In Unix and other OSes, file system provides the machine-wide
hierarchical name space for most system resources. Applications
use&nbsp; resources mostly by the standard file system calls:
open/close/read/write. By mounting remote file-systems, remote name
space (and resources) can be imported and accessed transparently by
local applications.<br>
Plan9/inferno push this idea further by 3 ideas: 1. all resources are
represented as files. 2. each process has its own private name space
which can be customized according to applications' requirements. 3. an
uniform protocol - 9P is used for all remote message passings.[1][2]<br>
<br>
Channel provides a process local name space for asynchronous message
passing and event dispatching. Compared to unix/plan9 name space:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Channel's name space is a light-weight user-space data structure;
A process can create and use multiple name spaces for different
purpose.
Unix(plan9/inferno)'s name space is a more fundamental kernel feature
well integrated with all system facilities (shell, window system,..).
Each process has only one. </li>
  <li>file-system name spaces are based on function-call (local or
remote procedure call) or (request-response) semantics. Channel's name
space is for asynchronous message passing or one way request.</li>
  <li>file-system name spaces are based on normal client-server model:
file servers purely serve; ie. clients will import names from servers,
but servers never import names from clients. Channel is peer-peer
model; connected channels will import names from each other for
communication.</li>
  <li>In file-system name spaces, names refer to assumely
stable/permanent entites (either disk files or long-running servers);
file name spaces are relatively static, ie, a specific name mostly
refer to
the same resource either local or from a specific server; operations on
names with stale/empty binding will result in serious errors. Channel
name spaces are purely dynamic. It is totally valid to have a Named_Out
object in name space without bound Named_In object (since message
subscribers may join in later). The binding of names (bound senders or
receivers) can be different between this and next invocations. Just as
RobinMilner has clarified [3]: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"... is built upon the idea that the
respondent to (or referent of) a name<br>
exists no more persistently than a caller of the name. In other words,
the notions of<br>
calling and responding are more basic than the notions of caller and
respondent; every<br>
activity contains calls and responses, but to have a persistent
respondent to x &#8211; one that<br>
responds similarly to every call on x &#8211; is a design choice that may be
sensible but is<br>
not forced."<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>File-systems identify entities by string path names in a
hierachical directories. Channel use different naming schemes in
different applications:
linear name space (such as integer ids), hierarchical name space (such
as
string path names), and associative name space (linda style)</li>
  <li>in plan9, request dispatching is unicast - only one server get
req and serve it. Channel can support various dispatching policies -
broadcast, unicast, buffered,...</li>
  <li>file-system api is stream oriented: byte-streams are read from
file or write to file. channel's api is discrete message oriented.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId82643"></a>7.2 compare STL and
Channel</h4>
Some mapping between STL and Channel's concepts:<br>
<ul>
  <li>containers (sequence, assoc) &lt;=&gt; name spaces
(linear/hier/assoc)</li>
  <li>elements in container &lt;=&gt; names (unit/element in name space)</li>
  <li>iterator_range (target of algorithms) &lt;=&gt; name binding set
(sender-&gt;receiver(s), receiver-&gt;sender(s)) target of dispatchers</li>
  <li>algorithms &lt;=&gt; dispatchers</li>
</ul>
Dispatchers are defined using named bindings of senders and receivers,
which is provided by name space; similar to that STL algorithms are
defined in iterator range of [begin_iterator, end_iterator), while
iterator range is provided by containers.<br>
