[section:Alternatives Appendix: Alternatives]

This section compares the features offered by this library with similar features offered by other libraries and by the new C++0x standard.

[section Local Functions]

The following table compares local function features.

[table
[
    [ Local Function Feature ]
    [ This Library ]
    [ Local Classes ]
    [ __CPP0x_lambda__ ]
    [ __Boost_Lambda__ ]
    [ __Boost_Phoenix__ ]
]
[
    [ ['Program body using usual C++ syntax] ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ No. ]
    [ No. ]
]
[
    [ ['Can be passed as template parameter (e.g., to STL algorithms)] ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ No (see "local class" in __StroustrupGlossary__). ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ Yes. ]
]
[
    [ ['Bind variables in scope] ]
    [ Yes, bind by value, constant value, reference, and constant reference (also bind the object `this`).
However, the names of the bound variables must be repeated one by one.]
    [ No. ]
    [ Yes, plus there is short-hand syntax to bind all variables in scope at once (by value or by reference).
However, there is no bind by constant value nor by constant reference. ]
    [ No. ]
    [ Yes. ]
]
[
    [ ['Can be defined within expressions] ]
    [ No, defined only within declarations. ]
    [ No, defined only within declarations. ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ Yes. ]
    [ Yes. ]
]
]

For example, using this library local functions:

[table
[ [__Variadic_Macro_Syntax__] [__Sequencing_Macro_Syntax__] ]
[ [ [add_boost_local_va_cpp] ] [ [add_boost_local_cpp] ] ]
]

Or using C++ member functions of local classes:

[add_local_class_cpp]

Or using __CPP0x_lambda__ functions:

[add_cpp0x_lambda_cpp]

Or using __Boost_Lambda__ functions:

[add_boost_lambda_cpp]

Or using __Boost_Phoenix__:

[add_boost_phoenix_cpp]

[section Local Blocks]

The authors know of no other library or language feature that supports local blocks (i.e., with the ability to bind by constant value or reference).

[endsect]

[section Local Exits]

This library local exits provide a functionality very similar to the one provided by __Boost_ScopeExit__ but with the following additional features:

* Bind by constant (value or reference).
* Bind the object `this`.
