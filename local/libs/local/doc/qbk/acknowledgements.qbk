[section:Acknowledgments Acknowledgments]

This section attempts to recognize the contributions of /all/ the different people that participated directly or indirectly to the design and development of this library.

Thanks to Steven Watanabe and Vicente Botet for suggesting to use __Boost_ScopeExit__ binding to emulate local functions (in the context of constant-correct checking of block invariants).

Thanks to Alexander Nasonov for clarifying how __Boost_ScopeExit__ binding could be used to implement local functions.

Thanks to Pierre Morcello for suggesting to use `return;` to exit local blocks (in the context of a discussion about a possible [@http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2009/09/156012.php Boost.Breakable] library).
Thanks to Pierre also for sharing some code that already experimented with implementing local functions using __Boost_ScopeExit__ binding (even if this library was not developed using such a code).

Thanks to John Bytheway for refining the authors' technique that allows this library to pass local functions as template parameters.

Thanks to Jeffrey Lee Hellrung for suggesting the use of the "keyword" `bind` to bind variables in scope.

Finally, many thanks to the entire __Boost__ community and [@http://lists.boost.org mailing list] for providing valuable comments about this library and great insights on the C++ programming language.
