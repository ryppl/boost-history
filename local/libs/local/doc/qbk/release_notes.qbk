[section TODO]

# Verify compilation and run-times on all compilers one last time.

# Consider adding `types(...)` for "overloading as polymorphism".
Still, a unbound parameter with multiple types will keep one single default value (because it's not worth the added complexity to support multiple default values for each different type as with `defaults(...)`) -- document this.

# Consider adding `bind_type type` to specify the bound parameter type directly so not to use Boost.Typeof to deduce such a type.

# Rework factorial_impl and Implementation section.

# Finalize Acknowledge section.

# Apply copyright to all files.
