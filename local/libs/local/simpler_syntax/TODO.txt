* Rework a no-macro version of the factorial example.
    >>  Ask boost about inline -- is it useful?
    >>  Tell boost that split-macros can support recursion at the cost of
        allowing `this` within the function body (so no error if used instead
        of `this_`).


* Rename function_ref to function (because it now has a default constructor so it's not a reference anymore).


* Double check all local function syntax elements (from Grammar) -- auto, register, etc.

* Rename is_xxx.hpp to xxx.hpp for all PP_KEYWORD and add the strip (leading) macros.



* Send comments on variadic_macro_data:




* Add comparison with Look at Alex-Steven's syntax to docs:
    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/168612/focus=168694
    >> This syntax uses same typeof trick to deduce result type.
    >> This syntax uses a strange macro-into-macro for bind. I don't.
