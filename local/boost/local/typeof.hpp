/**
 * @brief This macro expands to the fully qualified type of a variable bound
 *  to to local functions, local blocks, and local exits.
 *
 * The type is fully qualified in that it contains the extra constant and
 * reference qualifiers when they are specified for binding by constant and by
 * reference.
 * For example, if a variable named <c>x</c> of type <c>T</c> is:
 * @li Bound by value using <c>bind x</c> then
 *  <c>BOOST_LOCAL_TYPEOF(x)</c> is <c>T</c>.
 * @li Bound by constant value using <c>const bind x</c>
 *  then <c>BOOST_LOCAL_TYPEOF(x)</c> is <c>const T</c>.
 * @li Bound by reference using <c>bind& x</c>
 *  then <c>BOOST_LOCAL_TYPEOF(x)</c> is <c>T&</c>.
 * @li Bound by constant reference using <c>const bind& x</c>
 *  then <c>BOOST_LOCAL_TYPEOF(x)</c> is <c>const T&</c>.
 *
 * Within local functions, local blocks, and local exits, this macro can be
 * used to deduce the bound variable types to declare local variables, check
 * concepts (using Boost.ConceptCheck), etc (see @RefSect2{Advanced_Topics,
 * Advanced Topics} section).
 *
 * @Params
 * @Param{bound_variable_name,
 *  The name of the bound variable for which the type is being deduced.
 * }
 * @EndParams
 *
 * @See @RefMacro{BOOST_LOCAL_FUNCTION_PARAMS}, @RefMacro{BOOST_LOCAL_BLOCK},
 *  @RefMacro{BOOST_LOCAL_EXIT}, @RefSect2{Advanced_Topics, Advanced Topics}
 *  section.
