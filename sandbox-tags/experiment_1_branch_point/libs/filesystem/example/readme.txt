This directory contains tools for reporting regression test status.
These tools are just parked here temporarily.

Once the Filesystem Library passes formal review (assuming it does!),
the regression test reporting tools will move somewhere else,
perhaps boost-root/tools/status

The file regr_report.bat shows how the tools are invoked.
