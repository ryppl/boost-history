<p>
Fernando Cacciola, Darren Cook, Beman Dawes, Jeremy Maitin-Shepard and Daryle
Walker from the Boost mailing list provided useful suggestions for improvement
on the first alpha releases of the library. Gang Wang discovered several
bugs in the code. Thomas Wenisch brought out the idea of "sequence sets"
from which sequenced indices were designed. Giovanni Bajo, Chris Little and
Maxim Yegorushkin tested the library on several platforms. Rosa
Bern&aacute;rdez proofread the last version of the tutorial.
</p>

<p>
Pavel Vo&#382;en&iacute;lek has been immensely helpful in thoroughly reviewing
every single bit of the library, and he also suggested several extra
functionalities, most notably range querying, safe mode, polymorphic key
extractors and MPL support. Thank you!

Boost.IndexedSet could not have been written without Aleksey Gurtovoy
et al. superb <a href="../../../libs/mpl/doc/index.html">Boost MPL
Library</a>. Also, Aleksey's techniques for dealing with ETI-related
problems in MSVC++ 6.0 helped solve some internal issues of the library.

The internal implementation of red-black trees is based on that of SGI STL

I would like to dedicate this piece of work to Rosa Bern&aacute;rdez, my very first
C++ teacher, for her unconditional support in many endeavors of which programming is
by no means the most important. In memory of my cat L&oacute;pez (2001-2003): he
lived too fast, died too young.
