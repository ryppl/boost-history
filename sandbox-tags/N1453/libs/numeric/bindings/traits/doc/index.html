<h1>boost::numeric::bindings::traits library</title>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
The traits library is intended to make abstraction of
<ul>
<li>Underlying vector and matrix types
<p>All bindings should be independent from the actual matrix and vector
types that are used for calling the bindings. Currently the bindings
are targeted to support ublas, std::vector, std::valarray and TNT.
<li>Calling conventions
<p>There are also bindings provided for libraries that are typically
implemented using Fortran like BLAS and LAPACK. A mapping thus
needs to be performed between C and Fortran calling conventions.
</ul>
