Policy-based Smart Pointer Tests

To build these tests, you must first configure your path to the Boost 1.30
sources.  Edit the makefile and specify the appropriate SDIR.  The provided
makefile assumes that your compiler can already find the Boost headers in
the system include directory.  These tests have only been certified to pass 
with gcc-3.3 on Linux.  They almost compile on VC7.1, but the lack of ADL has 
slowed porting to that compiler.

The three tests smart_ptr_test, no_check, and assert_check should all compile.
smart_ptr_test should pass all tests.  Use --log_level=all for verbose output.
no_check should crash with a segfault or other memory error, since it attempts
to dereference a null pointer.  You can verify this in your debugger.
assert_check should finish executing, but should fail every test with an
exception or assertion.

The reject_null_* tests should fail to compile, as they attempt to violate
the compile-time interface of the reject_null_* policies.
