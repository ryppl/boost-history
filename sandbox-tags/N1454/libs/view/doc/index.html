<h1>The view library</h1>


<p>An <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/utility/iterator_adaptors.htm">iterator adaptor</a>
wraps a "dumb" STL iterator and adds some functionality; such an object is
often referred to as a <em>smart iterator</em>. 
In much the same way, a <em>container adaptor</em> or <em>view</em>
wraps a STL container and attaches some further functionality.
</p>
<p>
A view is (intended to be) a light-weight, immutable decorator to some existing data.
Usually, it will provide the same interface as a
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Container.html">STL container</a>,
but nothing further. Especially, a view will not implement methods
such as <code>insert()</code> and <code>erase()</code> which would modify
the underlying container.
</p>

<p>
This <a href="http://www.flll.jku.at/staff/private/roland/view/">implementation</a>
tries to keep the relation between adapted (or "smart") iterators and views
as close as possible.
This means that a view acts like a container which has an adapted iterator type
as its <code>iterator</code> type.
For instance, a <code>filter_view<...></code> will define 
<code>boost::filter_iterator_generator<...>::type</code> as its
<code>filter_view::iterator</code> type; its methods <code>begin()</code>
and <code>end()</code> will return filter iterators, etc.
</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

Sorry, no online documentation so far; meanwhile, check out the test examples from the 
<a href="http://www.boost.org/more/mailing_lists.htm#sandbox">Boost Sandbox</a>
CVS repository, or from <a href="http://www.flll.jku.at/staff/private/roland/view/boost_view.zip">here</a>.


<h2>Portability</h2>

The view library has been tested with gcc 2.95.3-6 (mingw special)
and gcc 3.2 (cygwin) together with Boost 1.29.0, and with MSVC++ 7.0
using Boost 1.28.0.



<h2>History</h2>


<p>The first to introduce a <a href="http://www.zeta.org.au/~jon/STL/views/doc/views.html">view library</a>
was Jon Seymour back in 1995.</p>
 
The most complete implementation of views so far is the 
<a href="http://www.zib.de/weiser/vtl/">View Template Library</a> 
by Gary Powell and Martin Weiser [PW99], [WP00]. 


<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

Gary Powell and Martin Weiser provided inspiration, ideas and feedback.

The implementation of <code>cyclic_iterator</code> is based upon
the work of Gennadiy Rozental.
