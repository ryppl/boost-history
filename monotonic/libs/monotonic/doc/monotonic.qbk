[section:intro Introduction]

The [*Boost.Monotonic] library provides storage, allocation and container types for use 
in high-performance and real-time applications.

The library provides a means for allocation to come from the stack, or the heap, or a combination of
 both the stack and the heap. Allocation is fast, because de-allocation does nothing. 
 As such, the amount of storage used by a monotonic allocator can only ever increase 
 - hence the name of the library.

Allocation can be ['regionalised] by application of user-supplied 'tag types' to specify a 
logical storage region. A second tag may be used to specify the 
['access type] for the region - which can be either global, guarded by a mutex, or using thread-local storage.

[*Boost.Monotonic] is generally used where performace is a key concern. 
By making deallocation a no-op, allocation of memory resources is extremely fast. 
In general, the programmer is required to release storage used at an appropriate time, 
however local scoping systems are provided by the library for the most common use cases.


Features include:

* fast allocation from the stack
* automatic extension to the heap as needed
* storage can be segmented into independant regions
* support for thread-safe storage, and thread-local storage
* storage can be accessed directly, providing a 'first-class stack' system
* containers that can use storage from the stack, from the heap, or both the stack and the heap

[section:tutorial Tutorial]

This tutorial progresses through the basic usage of the library, 
demonstrating how to use a monotonic allocator with STL containers, 
how to use monotonic storage directly without an allocator, how to use 
regions and access tags, and finally demonstrates the use of the 
supplied container library with stack-based local storage.

[section Basic Usage]

The following is a very quick introduction to [*Boost.Monotonic]:

``
#include <boost/monotonic/allocator.hpp>

using namespace boost;

int main()
{
    {
        std::list<int, monotonic::allocator<int> > list;
        for (size_t n = 0; n < 1000; ++n)
            list.push_back(n);
    }
    monotonic::static_storage<>::release();
    return 0;
}
``

Here we have created a `std::list` using a monotonic allocator. 
While we add new elements to the list in the for-loop, allocation is coming 
from storage in the default region with default access. The first 32k of allocation 
will come from the BSS segment embedded in the application image (the amount 
of such storage is configurable), then once that local storage is exhausted, 
later allocation requests will be serviced from the heap. Since de-allocation 
does nothing in a monotonic allocator, we must manually release the resources 
once we are finished, as shown above.

While this example is trivial, if you were to benchmark it against using 
a default `std::allocator` you will find that monotonic allocation is much faster[1]. 

This is one of the main reasons for using this library; to provide efficient storage 
and allocation for temporary containers.

We shall now move on to some more interesting examples, including how to use 
multiple containers that share the same strorage, using regions, using local 
stack-based storage, and dealing with threading issues.

[endsect]

[section Using Multiple Containers]

In this example, we create a map of ints to vectors of ints, 
with each container using a monotonic allocator:

``
int main()
{
    {
	typedef std::vector<int, monotonic::allocator<int> > Vector;
	typedef std::map<int, Vector, std::less<int>, monotonic::allocator<Vector> > Map;
	Map map;
	for (size_t n = 0; n < 10000; ++n)
	{
            map[rand()%100].push_back(n);
	}
    }
    monotonic::static_storage<>::release();
    return 0;
};
``

Again, storage will only ever increase, so we must release it after we have finished using it. 

Benchmarking the performance of this against other allocation schemes[2] show that 
monotonic allocation is extremely fast and efficient.

The key point here is that you can use a `monotonic::allocator` anywhere that 
you would otherwise use a `std::allocator` or any other STL-compliant custom 
allocator. Monotonic allocators of the same type are effectively stateless, 
and may be default-constructed, used, and discarded as needed. 

We will deal with stateful monotonic allocators that can use local stack-based storage in a later section.

[section Using Regions]

While it can be useful to have one storage area for all allocations, 
at times will will want to segment our memory usage into different ['regions]. 
This is done by passing a user-supplied ['region tag type] to the type signature 
of a `monotonic::allocator`, as shown here:

``
struct my_region_A { };
struct my_region_B { };

int main()
{
    {
        std::list<int, monotonic::allocator<int, my_region_A> > A_list;
        A_list.push_back(1);
        {
             std::list<int, monotonic::allocator<int, my_region_B> > B_list;
             B_list.push_back(2);
        }
        monotonic::static_storage<my_region_B>::release();
        A_list.push_back(3);
    }
    monotonic::static_storage<my_region_A>::release();
    return 0;
}
``

Here, we have defined two storage regions, designated with the type-tags `my_region_A` 
and `my_region_B`. These are passed as the second type argument to a `monotonic::allocator`
in order to segment out the storage used. These regions are independant of each other;
releasing storage for `B_list` does not effect the storage for `A_list`.
 
Using segmented storage systems helps with logical seperation of resource usage 
amoung different sub-systems within an application. It also helps with ensuring 
privacy when using local storage, as demonstrated below:

``
class System
{
    struct region {};
    typedef std::vector<Object, monotonic::allocator<Object, region> > Objects;

public:
    void update()
    {
		{
			Objects objects;
			GatherRelevant(objects);
			Process(objects);
			Update(objects);
		}
		// reset storage, ready for next update
		monotonic::static_storage<region>::reset();
    }
};
``

We have used a private region-tag `region` to guarantee that storage used 
by local containers such as `Objects` is not shared with any other system. 

Note that this is a typical use-case for monotonic allocation, as it uses a locally 
defined container which is populated, used and discarded regularly.

[endsect]

[section Using Monotonic Storage]

While monotonic allocators use monotonic storage, we can also use this storage 
directly and wherever we want efficient resource management.

``
int main()
{
    // define local storage of 4k on the stack.
    // allocations will use the heap after the inline stack-based storage
    // has been exhausted.
    monotonic::storage<4*1024> storage;
    {
		int &amp;num = storage.create<int>();
		std::string &amp;str = storage.create<std::string>();
		char *bytes = storage.allocate_bytes(3000);     

		// use num, str, bytes as needed

		// call std::string's destructor directly, or use storage.destroy
		storage.destroy(str);
    }
    return 0;
}
``

Of course, we could have just made `num`, `str` and `bytes` on the stack by declaring them as 
local variables and be done with it - well, except for having a dynamically-sized array of bytes
on the stack. There is no other functional difference in this case, except that you are 
responsible for invoking object destructors. So how is this at all useful?

We can use `monotonic::storage` as a form of "first-class scope" which can be created, 
manipulated, passed as as argument, returned as a value or reference, and destroyed as needed. 

In this sense, `monotonic::storage` is just like your very own C++ stack which you can share 
between objects and functions and even across process boundaries, independantly of the 
underlying machine-based stack.

Also unlike the stack, storage will use the heap when its local inline stack-based buffer is exhuasted. 
This makes it ideal for using things like local buffers and containers that generally will be small 
enough to fit onto the stack, but with the fallback safety of transparently using the heap to 
service later requests for the cases where that inline buffer is not large enough.
