trees.html

 * 'See the example file xml_grammar.hpp (in libs/spirit/example/...'
   The file doesn't exist.

organisation.html

 * '[*error_handling]. The framework would not be complete...'
   The format of this is a bit confusing. Why is error_handling written like a class/function name? Is it one?

confix.html

 * The top-level header 'confix parsers' seems needless. I've removed it.
 * Link needed for `as_parser`.
 * Is 'expr' used as an abbreviation? For example in the context of 'expr parser'. It may be confused easily with the `expr` that comes up in the example code.

list_parsers.html

 * 'parser generators are described here and here'
   Sort out the links here.

functor_parser.html

 * '(see In-depth: The Parser)'
   Link this up

regular_expression_parser.html

 * Link to 'The Scanner Business'

distinct.html

 * Add link for ASM.1.

lazy_parser.qbk

 * First word should link to docs section on Spirit's Closures.

 * 'When `base` is being parsed, in your semantic action, store a pointer to the selected ?( base | ('`' >> base >> '`') ) in a closure variable'

select_parser.qbk

 * Link at bottom of page referring to PHOENIX_LIMIT should be more direct.

switch_parser.qbk

 * Got a link for Sam Nabialek?

portability.qbk

 * 'Spirit v1.6.x'
   Link to the newest in the series

   etc... for all pages

style.qbk

 * Sort links on this page.
 * It would be better if the page 'Boost coding guidelines' was hosted on the boost website, rather than a login-only yahoo groups page.

rationale.qbk

 * 'Spirit is greedy --using straight forward, naive RD'
