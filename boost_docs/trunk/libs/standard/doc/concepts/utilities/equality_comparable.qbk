[section Equality Comparable]
A type `T` is /equality comparable/ objects of type `T` can be compared using
the equality comparison operator (`==`) and that comparison defines an /equivalence 
relation/. An equivalence relation over type a `T` is a binary relation between any 
two objects of type `T` that denotes them as being "equivalent". The specific 
meaning of the term "equivalent" depends on the semantics of the type modeling this 
concept.

Equivalence relations have the following properties:

* [*Reflexivity] `t == t` is always `true`.
* [*Symmetry] If `t == u` is `true`, then `u == t` is `true`.
* [*Transitivity] If `t == u` and `u == v` are `true`, then `t == v` is `true`.

        [`t != u`]
        [Convertible to `bool`]
        [
            Returns `true` or a value covertible to `true` if the object
            `t` is not equivalent to `u`. Note that `t != u` is equivalent
             to `!(t == u)`.
        ]
    ]
]

[heading Notes]
If an type `T` provides an equivalence comparison operator (`==`) then, the
inequality comparison operator (`!=`) can be implemented as:

    bool operator !=(const T& t, const T& u)
    {
        return !(t == u);
    }

[heading Examples]
A type `T` is required to be [StdEqualityComparable] when an object of type `T` is
compared to another object of type `T` using either the equality comparison (`==`) 
or the inequality comparison (`!=`) operator.

    // Using the equality comparison operator to compare two objects of type T
    // requires that type to be EqualityComparable.
    template <typename T>
    bool equality_compare(const T& t, const T& u)
    {
        return t == u;
    }
    
    // Using the inequality comparison operator to compare two objects of type T
    // requires that type to be EqualityComparable since inequality can be
    // implemented in terms of equality.
    template <typename T>
    bool inequality_compare(const T& t, const T& u)
    {
        return t != u;
    }
