[Faster] To copy the library into an existing boost subversion checkout, do 
the following, replacing "BOOST" with the path of the boost checkout: 

  svn export --force http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/endian BOOST

[Slower] To install with an export of the Boost trunk, do the following 
in the directory where you want the resulting endian directory:

  mkdir endian
  svn co http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/endian endian
  svn export --force http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk endian
  
Boost.Endian is a header only library, so the library is ready to go
without running a build.  
  
To run the tests:

  cd endian/libs/endian/test
  bjam
