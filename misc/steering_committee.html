<title>Boost Steering Committee Proposal</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Proposal for a Boost Steering Committee</h1>
<p>Dave Abrahams initialed discussions of Boost governance with other moderators 
just before BoostCon 2011. This proposal is based on discussions at BoostCon 2011 between Dave Abrahams, 
Beman Dawes, Jeff Garland, Marshall Clow, Robb Stewart, and Steven Watanabe. 
Others later joined the discussion.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Since inception, the moderators of the Boost developers mailing list have 
been the executive decision making authority for Boost. That approach worked 
well initially, but as Boost has grown the moderators are no long effective as a 
decision making group, and are too small a group to represent the larger Boost 
community.</p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>That the mailing list moderation and executive decision making functions be 
separated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Mailing list moderators will perform the functions needed for mailing 
    list moderation.</li>
    <li>The Steering Committee will perform functions associated with executive 
    decision making.</li>
    <li>There will not necessarily be any overlap between the moderators and 
    steering committee membership.</li>
    <li>When a single person is needed to represent Boost, such as when dealing 
    with outside entities like the SFC, that person be appointed by the Steering 
    Committee.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Steering Committee</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The working name is &quot;Steering Committee&quot; until such time as a better name 
  arises.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">The committee will have enough members to represent a wide range 
  of views, but not so many members as to become unwieldy.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">The committee will choose its own membership. The Boost 
  moderators will choose the startup membership.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The committee will operate transparently, in the Boost tradition of 
  openness.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The committee will choose its own operating procedures.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Suggested initial operating procedures</h2>
<p>The committee will have a wiki and a mailing list. They will be readable by 
anyone, but other access to be determined by the committee.</p>
<p>The committee will only make final decisions that have been proposed in 
writing. Proposals must have been available on the wiki for review and 
discussion for some minimum amount of time before the committee acts. The final 
decision on each proposal will be documented on the wiki.</p>
<p>The committee will meet in person every year at BoostCon.</p>
<h2>To be decided</h2>
<p>The gravity of decisions to be made by the committee varies.</p>
<p>Some decisions are best left to individuals or other boost teams. The 
appropriate committee action would be to pass authority and responsibility to 
that other individual or team.</p>
<p>Some decisions aren't particularly important in their outcome, but a decision 
needs to be made to avoid deadlock. A quick vote and a simple majority would be 
sufficient process.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, some decisions are critical to the future of Boost. A 
full and lengthy airing of concerns and investigation of alternatives is 
justified. Consensus is highly desirable. In person (i.e. at BoostCon) 
discussion need to occur.</p>
<p>Procedures need to be worked out to handle decisions with process appropriate 
for the relative gravity of the decision. Mid-weight gravity should imply 
mid-weight process.</p>
