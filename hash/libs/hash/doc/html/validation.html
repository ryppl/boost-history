<H2>The MaybeBoost Hash Library: Validation</H2>

<H3>Test Vectors</H3>

<P>The tests include all the test vectors available in the standards, as well as others verified against reference or other well-known implementations.

<P>For MD4 and MD5, these are the test vectors from the RFCs.  For SHA-1 and the SHA-2 family, they come from the FIPS standard and the SHAVS examples.  SHA-0 is checked against a published collision.  CubeHash is tested against answers obtained from the NIST-submitted "reference" implementation.

<P>See <tt>libs/hash/test/</tt> for full details.

<H3>Speed vs Code Clarity</H3>

<P>All implementations were initially written to follow the specs very closely to simplify manual verification by code inspection.  These implementations, however, are usually a few hundred percent slower than optimized implementations, and occasionally much worse than that.

<P>In various places, optimizations have been applied, and these are used by default.  The original implementations are still accessible, however, by defining <tt>BOOST_HASH_NO_OPTIMIZATION</tt>.  This is useful for checking the correctness of the optimizations.
