const_aware:
 - check for in-Python construction of proxies (maybe needs to be disabled with something like no_init)
 - smarter shared_ptr converter registration (take held_type into account)
 - test subclasses and back-reference wrappers
 - documentation!

to_python:
 - create rvalue converters corresponding to copy_to_XXX policies
