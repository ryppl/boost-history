\section{Introduction}
Class template \texttt{tr1::function} stores function objects of
arbitrary types. While these function objects are copied, invoked, and
destroyed by the implementation as needed, their identities are
completely lost to the user: there is no way to access the stored
function object or determine its type. 

Both of these abilities are desirable, especially when
using \texttt{tr1::function} to build higher-level callback constructs
such as delegates or signals/slots. In particular, these capabilities
are required to implement delegates that can ignore duplicate targets
and remove targets based on their function object values. For
instance, one can imagine creating a \texttt{delegate} class template
that operates like this (and is implemented with a container of
\texttt{tr1::function} objects):

\begin{verbatim}
enum mouse_button { mb_left, mb_middle, mb_right };

delegate<void(int x, int y, mouse_button)> on_click;

on_click += display_context_menu();

// Say we want to record clicks for playback later...
on_click += record_macro(macro_name);

// We're done recording the macro: remove the function object
on_click -= record_macro(macro_name);
\end{verbatim}

Here, the implementation of \texttt{-=} needs to compare function
object wrappers for equality. Herb Sutter discusses these limitations in much
more detail~\cite{Sutter03:Observer} and provides additional motivation for
these features.

\section{Target access}
I propose to introduce two member functions to class template
\texttt{tr1::function}, \texttt{type} and \texttt{target}. The
\texttt{type} member function returns an \texttt{std::type\_info}
object referring to the type of the target function object (or
\texttt{typeid(void)} if there is no target):

\begin{verbatim}
tr1::function<int(int, int)> f = std::plus<int>();
assert(f.type() == typeid(std::plus<int>));
tr1::function<int(int, int)> g;
assert(g.type() == typeid(void));
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{target} member function is templated on the type of the
target and returns a pointer to the actual target function object (if
the type matches) or a null pointer (if the type does not match),
e.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
std::plus<int>* fp = f.target<std::plus<int> >(); // OK, fp points to stored object
std::minus<int>* nfp = f.target<std::minus<int> >(); // OK, NULL pointer
\end{verbatim}

There are several alternatives to the member functions proposed, the
most popular of which is some form of \texttt{operator==} for
\texttt{tr1::function}. I am not proposing any variant of
\texttt{operator==} because:
\begin{itemize}

\item We would still require the \texttt{type} and \texttt{target}
member functions (or something like them) to have full access to the
function object targets.

\item \texttt{operator==} is unimplementable for
\texttt{tr1::function} within the C++ language, because we do not have
a reliable way to detect if a given type \texttt{T} is
\textsc{Equality Comparable} without user assistance.

\item A more limited form of \texttt{operator==}, which can compare a
\texttt{tr1::function} object to any potential target, is
implementable but less intuitive.\footnote{Peter Dimov noted that
this form of \texttt{operator==} is sufficient to implement
delegates.} We need more experience before we can commit to such a
strange form of operator.

\item Adding \texttt{operator==} is not useful unless all of the
standard binders also add \texttt{operator==}. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Text}
Add to the end of the class definition in 3.4.3 [tr.func.wrap.func]:
\begin{verbatim}
// function target access
type_info type() const;
template<typename T> T* target();
template<typename T> const T* target() const;
\end{verbatim}

Add a new section 3.4.3.5 ``function target access''  
[tr.func.wrap.func.target]:

\begin{verbatim}
type_info type() const;
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\textbf{Returns}: If \texttt{*this} has a target of type
\texttt{T}, \texttt{typeid(T)}; otherwise, \texttt{typeid(void)}.

\noindent\textbf{Throws}: will not throw.

\begin{verbatim}
template<typename T> T* target();
template<typename T> const T* target() const;
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\textbf{Requires}: \texttt{T} must be a function object type
callable with parameter types \texttt{T1}, \texttt{T2}, $\ldots$,
\texttt{TN} and return type \texttt{R}.

\noindent\textbf{Returns}: If \texttt{type() == typeid(T)}, a pointer
to the stored function target; otherwise, the NULL pointer.

\noindent\textbf{Throws}: will not throw.
