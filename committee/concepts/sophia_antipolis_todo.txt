- Should the concepts ConstructibleWithAllocatorSuffix,
ConstructibleWithAllocatorPrefix, etc. be "auto" or not? Making them
"auto" eliminates a lot of typing and can make use of scoped-allocator
support for existing types that have an allocator_type and an
appropriate constructor. On the other hand, it's possible that we
could get types that accidentally match one of these concepts when in
fact they don't have the right allocator semantics; this could happen
with types that have unconstrained constructor templates, which would
match the concept but fail to instantiate. If we make the concepts
non-"auto", we'll have to write concept map templates for all of the
containers, pair, tuple, function, etc., and users will also have to
do so. We also won't get the benefit of scoped allocators
automatically, for types that do follow the normal guidelines for
accepting allocators.
