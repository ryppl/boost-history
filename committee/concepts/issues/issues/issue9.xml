<title>Memory-allocation concepts are too fine-grained</title>

<discussion>
  <p><tt>Newable</tt> and <tt>Deletable</tt>
  and <tt>HeapAllocatable</tt> are awfully fine grained and low
  level. Can we get rid of them, or at least consolidate them? Yes,
  it's possible to write types that can be created on the stack but
  not with <tt>new</tt>, but do our library algorithms really need to
  distinguish between constructable, new-able, and
  heap-allocatable?</p>
