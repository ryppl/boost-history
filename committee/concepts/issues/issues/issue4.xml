  <p>We should consider saying that <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> is a
  refinement of an appropriate specialization
  of <tt>Constructible</tt>, not
  just <tt>Destructible</tt>. Specifically, one would think
  that <tt>MoveConstructible&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a refinement
  of <tt>Constructible&lt;T, T&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt>. In that case, the
  body of <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> would go away.</p>
