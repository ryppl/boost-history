  <p>The purpose of this document is to record the status of issues
  which have been related to the authors of the C++ concepts
  proposals. Issues represent potential defects in the language
  or library proposals for concepts. </p>

  <p>This document contains only issues which are actively being
  considered for concepts. That is, issues which have a
  status of <a href="concepts-active.html#New">New</a>, <a href="concepts-active.html#Open">Open</a>, 
  <a href="concepts-active.html#Ready">Ready</a>, and <a href="concepts-active.html#Review">Review</a>. See
  <a href="concepts-defects.html">Concepts Defect Report List</a> for issues considered defects and 
  <a href="concepts-closed.html">Concepts Closed Issues List</a> for issues considered closed.</p>

<statuses>
  <p><b><a name="New">New</a></b> - The issue has not yet been
  reviewed. Any <b>Proposed Resolution</b> is purely a
  suggestion from the issue submitter, and should not be construed as
  the view of the committee.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Open">Open</a></b> - The committee has discussed the issue
  but is not yet ready to move the issue forward. There are several
  possible reasons for open status:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Consensus may have not yet have been reached as to how to deal
            with the issue.</li>
        <li>Informal consensus may have been reached, but the committee awaits
            exact <b>Proposed Resolution</b> wording for review.</li>
        <li>The committee wishes to consult additional technical experts before
            proceeding.</li>
        <li>The issue may require further study.</li>
     </ul>

  <p>A <b>Proposed Resolution</b> for an open issue is still not be
  construed as the view of committee. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Dup">Dup</a></b> - The committee has reached consensus that
  the issue is a duplicate of another issue, and will not be further
  dealt with. A <b>Rationale</b> identifies the duplicated issue's
  issue number.  </p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD">NAD</a></b> - The committee has reached consensus that
  the issue is not a defect in the concepts proposal.</p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD Editorial">NAD Editorial</a></b> - The committee has reached consensus that
  the issue can either be handled editorially, or is handled by a paper (usually
  linked to in the rationale).</p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD Future">NAD Future</a></b> - In addition to the regular
  status, the committee believes that this issue should be revisited at the
  next revision of the standard.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Review">Review</a></b> - Exact wording of a
  <b>Proposed Resolution</b> is now available for review on an issue
  for which the committee previously reached informal consensus.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Ready">Ready</a></b> - The committee has reached
  consensus that the issue is a defect in the concepts proposal,
  the <b>Proposed Resolution</b> is correct, and the issue is ready to
  be integrated into the next concepts proposal.</p>

  <p><b><a name="WP">WP</a></b> - (Concepts Defect) - The committee has
  decided to accept the proposed resolution and the resolution is part
  of a concepts proposal draft.</p>

  <p><b>Pending</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  When prepended to
  a status this indicates the issue has been
  processed by the committee, and a decision has been made to move the issue to
  the associated unqualified status.  However for logistical reasons the indicated
  outcome of the issue has not yet appeared in the latest working paper.

  <p>Issues are always given the status of <a href="concepts-active.html#New">New</a> when
  they first appear on the issues list. They may progress to
  <a href="concepts-active.html#Open">Open</a> or <a href="concepts-active.html#Review">Review</a> while the committee
  is actively working on them. When the committee has reached consensus on
  the disposition of an issue, the status will then change to
  <a href="concepts-active.html#Dup">Dup</a>, <a href="concepts-active.html#NAD">NAD</a>, or
  <a href="concepts-active.html#Ready">Ready</a> as appropriate.  Once
  a Ready issue has made it into a draft of the concepts proposal, it
  is given the status of Working Paper
  ( <a href="concepts-active.html#WP">WP</a>). To streamline the
  process for concepts (since it is still a proposal, not part of the
  committee working paper), we will often skip the Review or Ready
  status.
