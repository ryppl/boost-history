<discussion>
  <p>For some functions, such as <tt>prev_permutation</tt> and <tt>next_permutation</tt> are predicated on <tt>Iter::reference</tt>, while others, such as <tt>sort_heap</tt>, are predicated on <tt>Iter::value_type</tt>. I am not sure which is correct, but it the inconsistency seems strange. This should only affect proxy references.</p>
