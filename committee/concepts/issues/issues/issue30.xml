<title>Should Predicates be on <tt>Iter::value_type</tt> or <tt>Iter::reference</tt>?</title>

<discussion>
  <p>Some algorithms, such as <tt>prev_permutation</tt> and <tt>next_permutation</tt>, are predicated on <tt>Iter::reference</tt>. Others, such as <tt>sort_heap</tt>, are predicated on <tt>Iter::value_type</tt>. I am not sure which is correct, but it the inconsistency seems strange. The choice should only affect proxy references.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
  <p>Predicates operator on the value types, because predicates aren't
  supposed to change the actual value. This change has been made
  throughout the concepts proposals.</p>
