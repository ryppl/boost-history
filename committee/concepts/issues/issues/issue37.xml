<title>Relation between move/swap concepts and <code>Regular</code></title>

  <p>I've been thinking about rearranging these things:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Have a 'move equivalent' version of <code>Regular</code>/<code>SemiRegular</code>.</li>
    <li>Move <code>Swappable</code> into <code>Regular</code>/<code>SemiRegular</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The reason for 2 is I expect for many people (it has been for me)
    <code>Regular</code> will be their standard concept to use for
    "types which are normal / sensible". The fact you can't sort
    a <code>Regular</code> type (as it isn't <code>Swappable</code>)
    seems a bit bizarre.</p>
