  <p>Slightly substantive issue: we should consider reviewing the
  names in 20.1.10 for consistent style. One suggestion is making them
  consistent with the names of the function objects in 20.5. (Except
  that some people would like <tt>HasModulus</tt> to have a different
  name, since x%y isn't strictly speaking the mathematical mod
  operation, even though the current name is consistent with the 20.5
  name <tt>std::modulus</tt>. So either that would be an exception to
  the goal of consistency with 20.5, or it means we need to look for a
  different naming convention.)</p>
