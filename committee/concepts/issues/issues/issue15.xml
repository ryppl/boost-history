<discussion>
  <p>In <tt>Callable</tt>: can the <tt>F</tt>, the first argument of
  operator(), be an rvalue? If so, what's the language rule that gives
  us a yes answer? If not, is it ok to rule that out? (General theme
  for many of our questions: what is the criterion we use, when we
  define a concept, to decide whether the concept's functions should
  take their argument by value, by const reference, by non-const
  reference, by rvalue reference, or whatever?)</p>

  <p>Note: The function object cannot be an <tt>rvalue</tt>.</p>
