<discussion>
  <p>Is <tt>Swappable</tt> right, or does it also need
    a <tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> signature? We think that <tt>Swappable</tt>
    does need to cover rvalue reference and that this concept probably
    needs to be changed, especially in light of this week's tinkering
    with <tt>swap</tt> and <tt>Swappable</tt> (LWG issue 742), but (a)
    Nobody in the room understands rvalue references well enough to
    say for sure, and (b) We aren't sure whether the relaxed signature
    checking from Tuesday night has any impact. We think the answer
    might be to put in one <tt>T&amp;</tt> signature, and two other
    signatures that default to the first.</p>
