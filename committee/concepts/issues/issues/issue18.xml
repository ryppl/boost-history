<title>Consistent naming for concepts headers</title>

<discussion>
  <p>Should <tt>&lt;iterator_concepts&gt</tt>
  and <tt>&lt;iterator&gt;</tt> be different headers? Probably. It's
  nice to be able to write constrained templates without pulling in
  all of <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt>, for example. On the other hand,
  which header should things like <tt>std::iterator</tt>
  and <tt>std::forward_iterator_tag</tt> go in? Also, at a higher
  level, some consistent naming or locating policy should be firmly
  established so that random number concepts, iterator concepts, and
  other concepts all are coherent.</p>
