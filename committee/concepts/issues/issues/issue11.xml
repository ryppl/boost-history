<title>Semiregular concept is strange</title>

  <p>Exactly why does <tt>Semiregular</tt> exist, and what's the
  design criterion for deciding which of the requirements
  in <tt>Regular</tt> should be relaxed for <tt>Semiregular</tt>?
  Matt's first thought was that <tt>Semiregular</tt> was there to
  describe the "almost regular" value type of <tt>std::map</tt>, but
  that's wrong; in this terminology map's value type is
  neither <tt>Regular</tt> nor <tt>Semiregular</tt>. Mat wonders
  whether there are any algorithms that need to distinguish between
    <tt>Regular</tt> and <tt>Semiregular</tt>. A preliminary search
  shows no use of it in the latest revision of the
  concepts-in-clause-25 paper. Can we get rid of <tt>Semiregular</tt>?
  (Note: <tt>Semiregular</tt> is used in the definition of
  the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept.)
