  <title>Meaning of "equivalent" in <tt>MoveAssignable</tt></title>

  <p>Substantive issue in <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>: the postcondition
    is that the constructed <tt>T</tt> object is equivalent to the old value of
    <tt>rv</tt>. What does equivalent mean? It's especially
    problematic when <tt>U</tt> and <tt>T</tt> are different types,
    but even for the same type it's not a defined term and not
    completely clear how it should be defined. (One might imagine that
    for the same type it should be defined in terms
    of <tt>operator==</tt>, but this concept doesn't mention that
    operator.)</p>

  <p><b>Doug Gregor</b>: the requirements on the move-assignment
    operator come directly from the corresponding table in the
    pre-concepts Working Paper, so this issue wasn't introduced by
    concepts.</p>
