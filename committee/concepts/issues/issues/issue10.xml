  <p>General semi-editorial issue: almost all of the "Remarks" are
  actually notes. This is obviously true in the case of Semiregular,
  for example. Note: this was due to a misunderstanding of the LaTeX
  macros, because these were all intended to be notes. Considered an
  editorial issue.</p>

<resolution>
  <p>Replace all "Remark"s in the paper with "Note"s.</p>
</resolution>
