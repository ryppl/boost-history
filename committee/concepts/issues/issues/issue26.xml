  <p>N2037, Concepts for the C++0x Standard Library: Introduction,
  removes current requirements based wording from chapter 17 and
  replaces it with concepts based wording.</p>

  <p>That's fine if we uniformly replace all requirements with
  concepts. But if we choose to leave even a single requirement in
  place, then the WP is in an inconsistent state since that
  requirement is no longer supported by the wording in 17.</p>

  <p>Even if we do remove all uses of requirements, that is unlikely
  to occur at a single point in time. Thus the WP will be in an
  inconsistent state until each and every chapter has been converted
  to concepts.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
  <p>Break N2037 into two papers. One adds the wording to support
  concepts. The other removes wording supporting requirements (and
  does any rewording of the concepts wording needed to reflect a
  concepts only approach.)</p>

  <p>Vote the "add concepts to the introduction" paper into the WP
  whenever the first of the other library chapters concepts are voted
  in.</p>

  <p>Vote the "remove requirements from the introduction" paper into
  the WP whenever the last old-style requirement is removed from the
  WP (if ever).</p>
