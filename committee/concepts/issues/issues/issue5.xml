<p>General issue: many of these core concepts, including
  <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, <tt>TriviallyCopyConstructible</tt>,
and <tt>ObjectType</tt>, mirror existing type traits
names. Essentially, type traits are a mechanism used in unconstrained
templates and concepts express something very similar in constrained
code. We should consider a uniform naming convention, in places where
the correspondence exists, to make the connection clearer. This is one
  motivation for using Has* and Is* uniformly.
