  <title><code>ArithmeticLike</code> conversions from integral, floating-point types should be <code>explicit</code></title>

<discussion>
  <p>We would like to use the <code>ArithmeticLike</code> concept in
  places where the user types might only have explicit conversions
  from the built-in arithmetic types, e.g., in
  class <code>duration</code>. For example, the user may have created
  an arithmetic emulator type but wanted to keep conversions to a
  minimum to make the type safer to use.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
  <p>In [concept.arithmetic], update the three constructor requirements in <code>ArithmeticLike</code> as follows:</p>
  <pre>
concept ArithmeticLike&lt;typename T&gt;
  : ... {
  <ins>explicit</ins> T::T(intmax_t);
  <ins>explicit</ins> T::T(uintmax_t);
  <ins>explicit</ins> T::T(long double); 
}
  </pre>
</resolution>
</issue>
