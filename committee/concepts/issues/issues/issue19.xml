  <p>We're not very happy about <tt>IteratorBase</tt>. It doesn't seem
  like anything that anyone would ever want to constrain a template
  on; there's no text following its definition to say what it is and
  what it's for; it appears unused except as, well, a base; it seems
  more like a macro to save a few lines of typing in the real
  concepts. Can we get rid of it? Or can we strengthen it into
    <tt>TrivialIterator</tt> and base all other iterator concepts on
    <tt>TrivialIterator</tt> instead?
