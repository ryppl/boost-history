<title>Requires clause for Destructible is unclear</title>

<discussion>
  <p>What does the Requires clause for Destructible actually mean?
  "All resources owned by the object" is either false (what about a
  type with a pointer member variable that doesn't call delete in the
  destructor?) or vacuous (if you define "owned" resources precisely
  as the resources that are relinquished in the destructor). This is
  probably another purely syntactic concept: a type that you can use
  as the target of a pseudo destructor call, or something like
  that. If we do believe that this is a purely syntactic construct
  then we might want to consider renaming it as HasDestructor.</p>

  <p><b>Doug Gregor</b>: the requirements on the destructor come
  directly from the corresponding table in the pre-concepts Working
  Paper, so this issue wasn't introduced by concepts.</p>

<resolution>
  <p>The vacuous sentence has been removed.</p>
