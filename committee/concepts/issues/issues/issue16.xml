  <p>Do we really need <tt>ArithmeticLike</tt>
  or <tt>IntegralLike</tt>? They're ugly concepts that don't
  correspond to any mathematical definition, and the requirement of
  convertibility from long long is a bit weird. The current clause 25
  proposal uses <tt>IntegralLike</tt>, but maybe it doesn't really
  need it. Probably those algorithms could be expressed either as real
  live integer types, built-in types only, or as types that describe
  an abelian group. <tt>IntegralLike</tt>, complete with things
  like <tt>&amp;&amp;=</tt>, seems both too constraining and too
  fuzzy.</p>
