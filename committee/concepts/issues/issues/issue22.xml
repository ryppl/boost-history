  <p>24.1.1 paragraphs 8 and 9 seem very oddly placed. They seem to be
    discussing the semantics of <tt>operator==</tt>, but textually
    they appear to be underneath the signature
    for <tt>operator-&gt;</tt>. This is probably a purely editorial
    issue. Another purely editorial issue: "any" should be capitalized
    at the beginning of the second sentence of paragraph 11.</p>
  <p>There's something missing in 24.1.1. The semantics of <tt>*r++</tt> has
   gotten lost in the shuffle. The old requirements table said that
    <tt>*r++</tt> gave us the value we would have gotten before the
   increment, but the n2500 version doesn't say that. Based on the
   words in n2500, all we really know about <tt>*r++</tt> is that it
   returns some unspecified value that's convertible
   to <tt>value_type</tt>. Similar issues apply
   in <tt>OutputIterator</tt>.</p>
