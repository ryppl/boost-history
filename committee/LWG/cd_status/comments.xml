<description>
        Interactions between several
        new features appear obscure, and very few examples are
        offered to guide understanding of the formal text on
        interaction between these new additions.
        We worry about the complexity
        of the programming model so created.

        Appropriate action would include making changes to the CD,
        identifying an issue as not requiring a change to the CD,
        or deferring the issue to a later point in time.

        Latin abbreviations are presented incorrectly.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Italicize all
        Latin abbreviations, append commas after each occurrence of
        <i>i.e</i>. and <i>e.g.</i>, and remove extraneous space
        after each such abbreviation.
</suggestion>
<rationale>
The "Chicago Manual of Style" says that i.e. and e.g. are never
italicized and always followed by a comma, so that's how they now
appear.

        Revise the

        lambda-captures arguments? Are type names in a throw-spec
        arguments? 'Argument' to casts, typeid, alignof, alignas,
        decltype and sizeof? why in x[arg] : arg is not an
        agrument, but the value forwarded to operator[]() is ? Does
        not apply to operators as call-points not bounded by
        parenthises ? Similar for copy initialization and
        conversion? what are Deduced template 'arguments'? what are
        'default arguments'? can attributes have arguments? what

        This definition is essentially worthless,

Characterizing the output of a translator is essentially

        Unspecified behavior does not clearly state whether or not

The cited text is in a note and thus non-normative.  The acceptable

        case. For creating a universal-character name, splice text
        to create a universal-character. In the case of a file
        ending without a newline, treat as if the newline was
        implictly added, with an empty line to follow if the last
        character was a back-slash.
</suggestion>
<rationale>
The undefined behavior with respect to creation of universal character
names is intended to facilitate a variety of implementation techniques
for supporting extended characters by making it impossible in a well-defined
program to determine which technique was actually used.  There was no
consensus to change that approach at this time.  The remaining issues have
been addressed.

        This undefined
        behaviour in token concatenation is worrying and we believe
        hard to justify. An implementation should either support
        this in a defined way, or issue a diagnosic. Documenting
        existing practice should not break existing
        implementations, although unconditionally requiring a
        diagnostic would lead to more portable programs.

        It would be
        preferred for attempts to modify string literals to be
        diagnosable errors. This is not possible due to the
        deprecated implicit conversion to pointer to
        null-terminated character sequence of non-const characters.
        If this deprecated conversion were remove (see other
        comments) then string literals are always accessed through
        const types, and the compiler can enforce the no
        modification rule. The only exception would be using
        const_cast to cast away constness, but this is already
        covered under the const_cast rules so needs no further
        detail here.

The specification covers all attempts to modify the contents of a
string literal, including via a pointer to the string when it is not
apparent that a string literal is the target. This is consistent with
the general treatment of const objects.

        The addition of
        static_assert (7p4) to the language raises the need to
        concatenate string representations of integral constant
        expressions (typically from a sizeof or alignof expression)
        with narrow string literals to provide an informative error
        message. There is no need to support arbitrary constant
        expressions and especially not floating point values or
        formatting flags. Likewise, the need is purely to support
        static_assert so only narrow string literal support is
        required, although generalizing to other literal types
        would be useful.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Define a syntax to support string-ization
        of integral constant expressions in a form eligible for
        string literal concatenation, 2.13.4p6. Suggested syntax:
        I" integral-constant-expression ". There is no raw variant,
        although it could combine with type specifier in the same
        way that the R prefix does, supporting u8I, uI, UI and LI.

        The current
        words suggest the declaration of a static integral constant
        data member of a class cannot be a definition. Trying to
        fix this wording in-place will be verbose and risk raising
        more confusion than it solves, so suggest a footnote to
        call out the special case
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add a footnote attached to the static data
        membmer rule: *static data member delcarations of intergral
        type may also be definitions if a constant integral
        expression is provided for an initializer.
</suggestion>
<rationale>
The in-class declaration of such a static data member is, in fact, not
a definition; an out-of-class definition must be provided if the member
is "used" as described in 3.2.

        Example is
        misleading as implicitly defined default constructor uses
        default initialization, not value initialization, for
        non-static data members. In the case of std::String this
        makes no difference, but it makes a big difference for
        fundamental types and pointers.

        <BR/><BR/>
        
         Here is an example from N2709.
        <BR/><BR/>

        local_task(local_task const&amp; other)=delete;
        <BR/>
        local_task(F func_):
        <BR/>
        func(func_)
        <BR/>{}
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        local_task(local_task&amp;&amp; other):
        <BR/>
        promise(std::move(other.promise)),
        <BR/>
        f(std::move(other.f))
        <BR/>{}
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        void operator() {
        <BR/>try
        <BR/>{
        <BR/>

        <BR/>}
        <BR/>
        catch(...)
        <BR/>{
        <BR/>
        promise.set_exception(std::current_exception());
        <BR/>}

        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        std::unique_future&lt;result_type&gt;
        res(task.promise.get_future());
        <BR/>
        std::thread(std::move(task));

        return res;
        <BR/>}
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        This can be rewritten simply as follows if move capture can
        be used in a lambda expression.

        Lambda is a language feature with an
        apparent dependency on &lt;functional&gt;. This increases
        dependency of language on library, and is inconsistent with
        the definition of freestanding in 17.6.2.4.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Change the text
        "a closure object behaves as a function object" to "a
        closure object is a built-in object which behaves as a
        function object"; and after "context.", insert " A closure
        object may be used without any need for
        &lt;functional&gt;." This makes clear what may already be
        implied, namely that lambdas can be used in freestanding
        implementations and don't increase dependency of language
        on library. (Marked as technical comment anyway because
        this clarity is technically important).
</suggestion>
<rationale>
The reference to 20.7 appears only in a note, not in normative text, and
is intended only to clarify the meaning of the term &#8220;function
object,&#8221; as defined there: &#8220;Function objects are objects with
an <TT>operator()</TT> defined.&#8221;  This creates no dependency on
&lt;functional&gt; or any other library facitlity.

        For argument dependant lookup (3.4.2) the

        A lambda with an empty capture list has

        The note spells

        as a pair of pointers. However, nothing in the rest of

        There is a
        strong similarity between a [&amp;]{} lambda capturing a
        stack frame, and a [this]{} lambda binding a member
        function to a class instance. The reference_closure
        requirement should be extended to the second case, although
        we need some syntax to create such an object that is
        distinct from the existing pointer-to-member syntax. This
        would be a cleaner alternative to the new std::mem_fn

        The requirement that a lambda meeting

        reference_closure makes lambda the language feature
        dependent on &lt;functional&gt;, which increases dependency

        Replace text "is

        The definition in p1 makes no allowance for
        overloaded operator[] that treats the expression as a
        simple function call, and does not support the

        Insert a new p2 describing the changed

        Together with footnote 60 there may be
        confusion that the postfix expression is always evaluated -
        even when part of an unevaluated operand. We believe the

        existing note would be a useful clarification.

        Conditionally supported behaviour gives a

</description>

</suggestion>
<rationale>
The definition of "safely-derived pointer" is exclusively formulated in
terms of pointers to dynamically-allocated objects. The conversion between
function pointers and object pointers is principally intended for use
with dynamic loading of shared libraries, which has minimal interaction
with garbage-collected objects.  There was no perceived need for the
Standard to say anything further on this topic.

        The defining

        Is an implementation permitted to reject
        this? constexpr int f() { return f(); } int a[f()]; AFAICT
        it is well-formed; f() seems to satisfy all the rules to
        make it a constant expression. I would hate compilation to
        become a potentially non-terminating experience.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add an escape
        clause to allow the implementation to reject excessively
        deep nesting of constexpr function evaluations. (This can
        possibly be a note, since it is arguable that this point is
        handled by the general rule on resource limits in 1.4/2. A
        sufficiently smart compiler could use tail recursion above,
        meaning that it would never run out of memory given this
        program though.)

        typeid
        expressions can never be constant, whether or not the
        operand is a polymorphic class type. The result of the

        reference refers to is polymorphic, with a virtual
        destructor - it can never be a literal type.

The result of <TT>typeid</TT> applied to a non-polymorphic type can
be treated as an address constant and thus usable for static
initialization (e.g., to initialize a reference). The result of

known at compile time. The polymorphic nature of the <TT>typeinfo</TT>

        It should be
        allowed to define constexpr recursively.
        <BR/><BR/>
        There is an explanation in N2235, Generalized Constant
        Expressions&#8212;Revision 5, as follows.
        <BR/><BR/>We (still)
        prohibit recursion in all its form in constant expressions.
        That is not strictly necessary because an implementation
        limit on recursion depth in constant expression evaluation
        would save us from the possibility of the compiler
        recursing forever. However, until we see a convincing use
        case for recursion, we don&#8217;t propose to allow it.
        <BR/><BR/>
        Then, here are the use cases where allowing recursion for
        constexpr is very useful.
        <BR/><BR/>
        Range of problem to be handled with constexpr would become
        extended. For example, user defined type (e.g. Complex
        type) could be placed in ROM area. But with current
        specification, a function defined with constexpr cannot be
        called recursively. As a side effect is not allowed in
        compile-time, it cannot be implemented to repeat anything
        without recursion. Although it could be implemented without
        recursion like func0, func1, func2 in an example below, it
        is not elegant solution.
        <BR/><BR/>
        constexpr double func0(double x) { /* ... */}
        <BR/>
        constexpr double func1(double x) { /* call for func0 */ }
        <BR/>
        constexpr double func2(double x) { /* call for func1 */ }
        <BR/>/*
        ... */
        <BR/><BR/>-
        Compile-time and runtime
        <BR/><BR/>As
        constexpr can be also evaluated both in compile-time and
        runtime, we need to discuss about both cases.
        <BR/><BR/>
        Runtime evaluation is just to execute it. If you eliminate
        constexpr keyword, it is executable as of now. Any modern
        compiler may optimize tail recursion easily.
        <BR/><BR/>
        Compile-time evaluation is the same thing as template
        recursion. It is necessary to support floating point
        operation, but it is already possible to calculate it in
        compile-time, so it&#8217;s ok.

        The two
        normative sentences in this paragraph appear to duplicate
        text elsewhere - but they aren't exact duplicates, which
        introduces uncertainty. 1. "An object declared in namespace
        scope with a const-qualified type has internal linkage
        unless it is explicitly declared extern or unless it was
        previously declared to have external linkage.". This nearly
        repeats 7.1.1/7: "Objects declared const and not explicitly
        declared extern have internal linkage." The former seems to
        allow more wiggle room - can an object be "previously
        declared to have external linkage" without having been
        "explicitly declared extern"? 2. "A variable of
        non-volatile const-qualified integral or enumeration type
        initialized by an integral constant expression can be used
        in integral constant expressions (5.19)." This nearly
        duplicates 5.19/2, bullet 4, 1st sub-bullet - "[... an
        integaral constant expression can use] an lvalue of
        effective integral type that refers to a non-volatile const
        variable or static data member initialized with constant
        expressions". The latter does not allow for lvalues of
        enumeration type (neither scoped not unscoped enumerations
        are integral types - 3.9.1/7, and note 44). This seems to
        be a flaw in 5.19/2.

        named by e", 5.1/5 is not excluded, which would imply that

        a reference to the type of e. Conversely, the second bullet

        Now that 'auto' is finally

        in template parameter declarations, as in

        <BR/><BR/><span lang=

        used in 14.1/18 in a different way (for constrained

        It would be

None of the standard attributes says that it is part of the type of an
object, which would be required for it to be so. Nonstandard attributes
might be, but nothing can be said normatively about such attributes.

<description>
        This section specifies that
        no name lookup is performed on any identifier contained in
        an attribute-token. This in particular implies that, for
        example, it is impossible to define a template class
        parameterized by its alignment. That restriction is
        unacceptable.
        <BR/><BR/>The original alignment
        proposal made that useful construct possible.
        <BR/><BR/>Furthermore paragraph 7.6.1/2
        appears contradictory with the rest of that section --
        since no name lookup is performed, how a 'type-id'is
        determined?
</description>

The comment is based on a misunderstanding: what is not looked up is,
informally, the attribute name (e.g., <TT>align</TT>), including the
<I>attribute-namespace</I>, if any.  The
<I>attribute-argument-clause</I>, if present, can have identifiers
that are looked up, depending on the attribute.

<description>
        Attributes should support pack expansion.
        For example, this would be extremely useful with the align
        attribute, directly supporting the (removed) functionality
        of aligned_union. NOte that aligned_union was removed as
        varaiant-unions were considered a complete replacement -
        however this is not true for variadic templates. Adding
        this support to attributes would remove the remaining need,
        and support similar attributes in the future.

        It is helpful
        for each subclause to contain a short paragraph introducing
        its intent an purpose. 7.6 has such a paragraph, but it is
        nested under a more specific subsection.

ISO editing guidelines insist that only leaf clauses have text. Moving
this sentence to 7.6 would violate that rule (not that the standard
doesn't violate it in many places, but we shouldn't make this worse
now).

        At present,
        function parameter packs can only occur at the end of a
        parameter-declaration-list. This restriction unnecessarily
        prohibits uses of function parameter packs in cases where
        template argument deduction isn&#8217;t needed, e.g.,
        <BR/><BR/>
        template&lt;class... T&gt; struct X { };
        <BR/><BR/>
        template&lt;class... T1, class... T2&gt;
        <BR/>struct
        X&lt;pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;...&gt; {
        <BR/>void f(T1...,
        T2...);
        <BR/>};
        <BR/><BR/>More
        importantly, this restriction is inconsistent with the way
        pack expansions are handled. For example, this template is
        well-formed (but X&lt;T..., int&gt; is a non-deduced
        context):
        <BR/><BR/>
        template&lt;class... T&gt; void f(X&lt;T..., int&gt;);
        <BR/><BR/>Therefore, the restriction that limits
        function parameter packs to the end of the
        parameter-declaration-list should be removed. Instead,
        function parameter packs not at the end of the
        parameter-declaration-list should be considered non-deduced
        contexts.

<description>
        The ability for
        an rvalue reference to bind to an lvalue opens a
        type-safety hole that becomes very dangerous with concepts.
        For example, consider vector&#8217;s push_back operation:
        <BR/><BR/>requires
        MoveConstructible&lt;T&gt; void push_back(T&amp;&amp;);
        <BR/><BR/>requires
        CopyConstructible&lt;T&gt; void push_back(const T&amp;);
        <BR/><BR/>For a
        copy-constructible T (which is also move-constructible),
        push_back does the right thing. However, if T is something
        that is move-constructible (e.g., unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;),
        the second overload is removed from considered (it is
        effectively SFINAE&#8217;d away), so only the first
        overload remains. Therefore, one could accidentally call
        push_back with an lvalue of type T, and push_back would
        silently move from the lvalue. The same problem occurs
        without concepts (albeit less frequently).
</description>
<suggestion>
        Prohibit rvalue
        references from binding to lvalues.
        <BR/><BR/>Unfortunately
        this change will break some current use cases of rvalue
        reference including the use of rvalue streams, and of the
        forward function itself. To resolve this we may want to
        consider three types of references:
        <ol>
          <li> The current
            reference.</li>
          <li> A non-const
            reference that only binds to rvalues.</li>
          <li> A non-const
            reference that will bind to both lvalues and rvalues.</li>
          </ol>
        Still another solution would be to adopt
        the &#8220;deleted function&#8221; solution for all
        functions. This solution is described in comment for 12.1,
        12.4, 12.8, but restricted to special functions in that
        comment. (See US NN).

        Implicitly-declared default constructors, destructors, copy
        constructors, and copy assignment operators are deleted
        when their definitions would be ill-formed. However, unlike
        with overloading and template argument deduction, access
        control is performed as part of the check for making one of
        these special function deleted. This inconsistency should
        be removed.
        <BR/><BR/>This change
        would sacrifice some backward compatibility in favor of
        consistency. With the current wording, checking that the
        following class &#8216;A&#8217; is CopyConstructible would
        proceed without error (it is not CopyConstructible):
        <BR/><BR/>class A {
        A(const A&amp;); };
        <BR/><BR/>With the
        proposed change, testing whether A is CopyConstructible
        would produce a diagnostic. To fix the problem, the user
        would have to use a deleted function:

        A(const A&amp;) = delete; };

The current treatment is sufficiently useful to warrant the inconsistency

        Despite all the attempts to unify
        initialization syntax, it is still not possible to
        copy-initialize base classes or non-static data members,
        which means the explicit keyword cannot have a bearing
        during evaluation of a constructor. A minimal addition to
        the grammar, allowing an optional = between the
        mem-initializer-id and braced-init-list would allow the
        user to choose between copy and direct initialization
</description>
<suggestion>
        Ammend the
        grammar for mem-initializer: mem-initializer-id =OPT
        braced-init-list Extend p3 to allow for Copy Initialization
        if the optional = is present: 3 The expression-list or
        braced-init-list in a mem-initializer is used to initialize
        the base class or non-static data member subobject denoted
        by the mem-initializer-id according to the initialization
        rules of 8.5 for direct-initialization, OR
        COPY-INITIALIZATION IF THE OPTIONAL = IS PRESENT BETWEEN
        THE MEM-INITIALIZER-ID and the BRACED-INIT-LIST.
        [Example:...
</suggestion>
<rationale>
There was no consensus for making the change as described. The concerns are
addressed for members (but not for base classes) by using the "="
form of the <I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I> on a member declaration
instead of a <I>mem-initializer</I>.

        templates were a great idea that is generally understood to
        have failed. In the decade since the standard was adopted,
        only one implementation has appeared. No current vendors
        appear interested in creating another. We tentatively
        suggest this makes the feature ripe for deprecation. Our
        main concern with deprecation is that it might turn out
        that exported constrained templates become an important
        compile-time optimization, as the constraints would be
        checked once in the exported definition and not in each
        translation unit consuming the exported declarations.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Consider deprecating exported templates,
        but no action yet. Examine interaction with constrained
        templates, and see if other more appropriate mechanism will
        support compile-time optimization.
</suggestion>
<rationale>
The Committee decided to remove the feature altogether instead of
deprecating it.

        It would be nice
        to allow template alias within a function scope, and
        possibly a scoped concept map. As these affect name lookup
        and resolution, rather than defining new callable code,
        they are not seen to present the same problems that
        prevented class and function templates in the past.

        Does a concept
        map have linkage? Reading this paragraph and 3.5 suggests a
        concept map template has external linkage, but not a
        'regular' concept map. Believe this is an oversight that
        the linkage words were not updated to provide an exception,
        rather than linkage of concept maps is intended.

        If the
        requirements of a constrained member that is a copy
        constructor, copy assignment operator, or destructor are
        not satisfied, then that user-declared special function
        will not exist. It appears that, in this case, the special
        function will then be <font size="3" face=
        "Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>implicitly</i> <font size=
        "3">defined, which is likely to either (a) fail to compile
        or (b) produce a function with the wrong semantics. For
        example:</font></font>
        <BR/><BR/>
        template&lt;ObjectType T&gt; class vector {
        <BR/>T* first, last,

        <BR/>requires
        CopyConstructible&lt;T&gt; vector(const vector&amp;);
        <BR/>};
        <BR/><BR/>If instantiated with a type that is not
        CopyConstructible, vector will get an implicitly-defined
        copy constructor that performs a copy of the pointers.
</description>

        Add to 14.5.1p5:
        <BR/><BR/>If the constrained member is a copy
        constructor (12.8), destructor (12.4), or copy assignment
        operator and its template requirements are not satisfied,
        then a copy constructor, destructor, or copy assignment
        operator, respectively, with the same signature as the
        constrained member (after substituting the class
        template&#8217;s template arguments for its template
        parameters) will be declared as a deleted function (8.4).

        Axioms are under-specified and provide
        little benefit to programmers, so they should be removed
        from the working paper. The optimizations permitted by
        axioms (see 14.9.1.4p4-5) are not compulsory (and,
        therefore, programmers cannot rely on them) and the
        semantics expressed by axioms cannot be verified by any
        implementation. The resulting specification has lead to
        great confusion (see the reflector thread &#8220;Are
        floating point types Regular?&#8221; starting with
        c++std-lib-22717). Given the level of confusion and the
        inability to verify the correctness of axioms, it is likely
        that many axioms written by programmers (including those
        specified in the candidate draft) will be incorrect.

        This section states that an
        axiom-definition defines a new semantics axiom but is
        unusually vague as to what those semantics might be.
        <BR/><BR/>The use of the '==' and '!='
        with completely new semantics, unrelated to anything we
        have seen before in C++ is both unwise and confusing,
        especially if the types involved in the expressions happen
        to have operator== and operator!= defined.
        <BR/><BR/>We strongly suggest use of
        different tokens, e.g. <font face=
        "Consolas, monospace">&#61683;, and opposed to this obscure
        usage/overload.</font>
        <BR/><BR/>The description is very
        vague. How many times is an implementation permitted to
        replace one expression by another one when they have side
        effects?

        DE-15 There is no implementation experience for axioms.
        Use of axioms is an area of active scientific research. It
        is likely that syntax changes will become necessary to make
        good use of axioms; having the syntax space already crowded
        is unhelpful. Axioms ought to be useful in concepts
        applicable to floating-point types (such as
        EqualityComparable), but IEEE floating-point types have
        special values such as NaN violating the axioms.

        auto concepts
        and axioms are incompatible. An axiom defines the semantics
        of an operaton or set of operations that describes the run
        time behaviour. A concept describes purely syntactic
        requirements at compile time. Where an auto concept will
        match anything that meets the syntax requirements, there is
        no way to know if the axioms will be met or not, and no way
        to opt out via some kind of negative concept map.

        The implicit
        equality comparison operator available to axioms has no
        semantic. It is not clear what expressing the condition if(
        a == b ) { conditional-axiom } would mean if a and b are
        not truly EqualityComparable. We suspect the intent of the
        'implicit defefinition' is to support declaring the
        equivalence of statements, a context where the operator
        will not actually be evaluated.

        It should be
        possible to support boolean constant expressions as

        in the library. Boolean expressions are very likely to be
        constraints when deadline with non-type template parameters
        and variadic templates, and constraints in these cases
        should feel just as natural as constraints on the type
        system.

        The use of &amp;&amp; as the separator for

        &#8216;&amp;&amp;&#8217; treats concepts as simple
        predicates, which ignores the role of concepts in
        type-checking templates. The more programmers read into the

        Exception specifications have proven close

        The concepts core language feature is applied to only
        some of the Standard Library clauses, and even then not
        always consistently.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Review all
        clauses of the Standard Library, and consistently apply
        concept technology wherever possible and appropriate. The
        proposed wording in WG21 N2781 exemplifies the necessary
        level of detail.

        &#8220;Concepts&#8221; are a significant new addition to
        the language, but are not exploited uniformly in the
        library as documented in CD 14882.

        The behavior of the library in the presence of threads
        is incompletely specified.
        <BR/><BR/>For example, if thread 1 assigns to X, then writes data
        to file f, which is read by thread 2, and then accesses
        variable X, is thread 2 guaranteed to be able to see the
        value assigned to X by thread 1? In other words, does the
        write of the data "happen before" the read?
        <BR/><BR/>Another example: does simultaneous access using operator
        at() to different characters in the same non-const string
        really introduce a data race?

        DE-2 Marking a constructor with "explicit" has semantics
        even for a constructor with zero or several parameters:
        Such a constructor cannot be used with list-initialization
        in a copy-initialization context, see 13.3.1.7. The
        standard library apparently has not been reviewed for
        marking non-single-parameter constructors as "explicit".
</description>
<suggestion>
        Consider marking zero-parameter and multi-parameter
        constructors "explicit" in classes that have at least one
        constructor marked "explicit" and that do not have an
        initializer-list constructor.
</suggestion>

        Support of char16_t/char32_t is insufficient. The basic_xxx
        classes of &lt;iostream&gt;, &lt;fstream&gt;,
        &lt;regex&gt;, etc. does not have typedefs for
        char16_t/char32_t.
        <BR/><BR/>
        Functions such as stoi, to_string in &#8216;21.4 Numeric
        Conversion&#8217; does not support char16_t/char32_t types.
</description>

        Add commented
        lines corresponding to char16_t, char32_t.

proliferate definitions of unused terms, I've removed the original

<description>
        The addition of move semantics to the
        language means that many library APIs leave an object in a
        safely-destructible state, where no other operations can
        safely be performed unless it is assigned a new value.
        Library presentation would be simplified and made more
        precise if we introduce a term for this state. By analogy
        with singular iterators suggest the term 'singular object'
        or 'the object is in a singular state'.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Define 'singular
        state' such that an object with a singular state can only
        be assigned to or safely destroyed. Assiging a new value
        typically removes the singular state. Note that objects
        with a singular state may not be safely copied, so you
        cannot put an object into a singular state by copying
        another object in a singular state. Use this new term in
        the postcondition of all library APIs that move from an
        rvalue reference. It might also be used to simplify the
        definition of singular iterator to an iterator value with a
        singular state.

        requires is now
        a keyword with a specific meaning related to concepts, and
        its use in library specifcation may be confusing. Generally
        the Requires clause is used to make requirements on the
        caller, not the library, so typically providing runtime
        pre-conditions. Suggest a new name to refflect that. Note

        We should make
        it clear (either by note or normatively) that namespace std
        may contain inline namespaces, and that entities specified
        to be defined in std may in fact be defined in one of these
        inline namespaces. (If we're going to use them for
        versioning, eg when TR2 comes along, we're going to need
        that.)
</description>
<suggestion>
        Replace "namespace std or namespaces nested
        within namespace std" with "namespace std or namespaces
        nested within namespace std or inline namespaces nested
        directly or indirectly within namespace std"

        One of goals of
        C++0x is to make language easier to teach and for
        'incidental' programmers. The fine-grained headers of the
        C++ library are valuable in large scale systems for
        managing dependencies and optimising build times, but
        overcomplicated for simple development and tutorials. Add
        additional headers to support the whole library through a
        single include statement.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add a new header &lt;std&gt; that has the
        effect of including everything in tables 13 and 14, except
        &lt;iosfwd&gt; and &lt;cassert&gt;. Add an additional
        header &lt;fwd&gt; that adds all declarations from
        &lt;std&gt; but no definitions.

        Does
        freestanding implementation require a full implementation
        of all listed headers? The reference to abort, at_exit and
        exit is confusing. Is a conforming implementation allow to
        deliver partial forms of these headers? If so which ones?
        Are empty versions of everything but &lt;cstdlib&gt;
        conforming?
</description>
<suggestion>
        Either strike the references to abort,
        at_exit and exit, or clarify which headers only require

        The phrasing is
        mildly ambiguous when using the word 'it' to refer back to
        the header - an unfotunate reading might confuse it with
        the translate unit, which is the subject of the surrounding
        clause.

<description>
        The definition of
        numeric_limits&lt;&gt; as requiring a regular type is both
        conceptually wrong and operationally illogical. As we
        pointed before, this mistake needs to be corrected. For
        example, the template can be left unconstrained. In fact
        this reflects a much more general problem with
        concept_maps/axioms and their interpretations. It appears
        that the current text heavily leans toward experimental
        academic type theory.
</description>
<suggestion>
        We suggest that a more pragmatic approach, in the spirit
        of C and C++, be taken so that calls to constrained
        function templates are interpreted as assertions on
        *values*, not necessarily semantics assertions on the
        carrier type.

<description>
        DE-18 The
        proposed C++ standard makes a considerable number of
        existing programs that have well-defined behavior according
        to ISO/IEC 14882:2003 have undefined behavior without a
        diagnostic hint to the programmer at all. This applies to
        the presence of threads and to pointer safety (the latter
        was introduced to support garbage collection). In order to
        avoid requiring a full code review for user code,
        facilities should be present that allow the compile-time
        detection of the advanced features of the proposed C++
        standard. It is expected that C++ implementations will
        provide a means (for example, a command-line switch) to
        turn off either or both of threads and garbage collection

        Scoped allocators and
        allocator propagation traits add a small amount of utility
        at the cost of a great deal of machinery. The machinery is
        user visible, and it extends to library components that
        don't have any obvious connection to allocators, including
        basic concepts and simple components like pair and tuple.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Sketch of proposed resolution: Eliminate scoped allocators,
        replace allocator propagation traits with a simple uniform
        rule (e.g. always propagate on copy and move), remove all
        mention of allocators from components that don't explicitly
        allocate memory (e.g. pair), and adjust container
        interfaces to reflect this simplification.

    There is some disagreement as to whether it actually <em>should</em> be 
    there. Some believed it did not belong because we do not guarantee that one 
    header includes another anywhere else in the standard. However, the paper 
    that was voted in explicitly did make that guarantee. Removing that

        add the move requirement for bind's return type.
        
        <BR/><BR/>
        For example, assume following th1 and th2,
        <BR/><BR/>
        
        void f(vector&lt;int&gt; v) { }
        
        vector&lt;int&gt; v{ ... };
        thread th1([v]{ f(v); });
        thread th2(bind(f, v));
        
        When function object are set to thread, v is moved to th1's
        lambda expression in a Move Constructor of lambda
        expression becuase th1's lambda expression has a Move
        Constructor. But bind of th2's return type doesn't have the
        requirement of Move, so it may not moved but copied.
        <BR/><BR/>Add
        the requirement of move to get rid of this useless copy.
        <BR/><BR/>And also, add
        the MoveConstructible as well as CopyConstructible.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add
        the following requirements.
        "<font color="#000000">it has a public move constructor
        that performs a member-wise move."</font>
        <BR/><BR/>Add
        the MoveConstructible.
</suggestion>
<notes>
We were not clear about what the submitter really
intended. Requiring that the result of bind be MoveConstructible
and/or CopyConstructible might be a start, but we would like to
communicate with the submitter.  [NOTE: We would like to see a
clarification of the wording for Returnable that makes it clear
that move-only types can be Returnable.]<BR/><BR/>
Peter Dimov comments: I believe that if <a href="#US72">US 72</a> is 
resolved as proposed by me above, the objects returned by bind will already 
be required to have a move constructor, otherwise bind would be unable to 
return them when F or a type in BoundArgs is move-only.

<notes>As with <a href="#JP41">JP 41</a>, these constraints are redundant given that function&lt;&gt; is

        std::allocator
        should be constrained to simplify its use on constrained
        contexts. This library component models allocation from
        free store via the new operator so choose constraints to
        match. The Allocator concept allows for a wider variety of
        allocators that users may choose to supply if their
        allocation model does not require operator new, without
        impacting the requirements of this template.
</description>
<suggestion>
        The primary allocator template should be
        constrained to require ObjectType&lt;T&gt; and
        FreeStoreAllocatable&lt;T&gt;. Further operations to be

        DE-22 The conditions for deriving from

        Consider stating the conditions in normative prose

        Scoped
        allocators represent a poor trade-off for standardization,
        since (1) scoped-allocator--aware containers can be
        implemented outside the C++ standard library but used with
        its algorithms, (2) scoped allocators only benefit a tiny
        proportion of the C++ community (since few C++ programmers
        even use today&#8217;s allocators), and (3) all C++ users,
        especially the vast majority of the C++ community that
        won&#8217;t ever use scoped allocators are forced to cope
        with the interface complexity introduced by scoped
        allocators. In essence, the larger community will suffer to
        support a very small subset of the community who can
        already implement their own data structures outside of the
        standard library. Therefore, scoped allocators should be
        removed from the working paper.
        <BR/><BR/>Some evidence of
        the complexity introduced by scoped allocators:
        <BR/><BR/>20.3.3, 20.5:
        large increase in the number of pair and tuple constructors
        <BR/><BR/>23: confusing
        &#8220;AllocatableElement&#8221; requirements throughout.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Remove support
        for scoped allocators from the working paper. This includes
        at least the following changes:
        <BR/><BR/>
        <BR/><BR/>Remove 20.8.3
        [allocator.element.concepts]
        <BR/><BR/>
        <BR/><BR/>Remove 20.8.7
        [allocator.adaptor]
        <BR/><BR/>
        <BR/><BR/>Remove 20.8.10
        [construct.element]
        <BR/><BR/>
        <BR/><BR/>In Clause 23:
        replace requirements naming the AllocatableElement concept
        with requirements naming CopyConstructible,
        MoveConstructible, DefaultConstructible, or Constructible,
        as appropriate.

        Allocator-specific move and copy behavior for containers
        (N2525) complicates a little-used and already-complicated
        portion of the standard library (allocators), and breaks
        the conceptual model of move-constructor and
        move-assignment operations on standard containers being
        efficient operations. The extensions for allocator-specific
        move and copy behavior should be removed from the working
        paper.
        <BR/><BR/>With the
        introduction of rvalue references, we are teaching
        programmers that moving from a standard container (e.g., a
        vector&lt;string&gt;) is an efficient, constant-time
        operation. The introduction of N2525 removed that
        guarantee; depending on the behavior of four different
        traits (20.8.4), the complexity of copy and move operations
        can be constant or linear time. This level of customization
        greatly increases the complexity of standard containers,
        and benefits only a tiny fraction of the C++ community.

        There is presently no way to
        convert directly from a <font size="2" style=
        "font-size: 11pt"><code>shared_ptr</code> to a
        <code>unique_ptr</code>.</font>
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add
        an interface that performs the conversion. See the
        attached, Issues with the C++ Standard" paper under Chapter
        20, "Conversion from <font size="2" style=
        "font-size: 11pt"><code>shared_ptr</code> to
        <code>unique_ptr".</code></font>
</suggestion>
<notes>We look forward to 
a paper on this topic. We recommend no action until a paper is 
available. We believe that the shared pointer must use the default deleter for the conversion to succeed.<BR/><BR/>
Peter Dimov comments: this is basically a request for shared_ptr&lt;&gt;::release 
in disguise, with all the associated problems. Not a good idea.

<rationale>There are non-trivial design issues which would need to be implemented and tested in the field for usability prior to standardization.

        [unique.ptr.single.ctor]/5 no longer requires for D not to
        be a pointer type. This restriction needs to be put
        back in. Otherwise we have a run time failure that
        could have been caught at compile time:

        unique_ptr&lt;int, void(*)(void*)&gt;

        unique_ptr&lt;int, void(*)(void*)&gt;
        p(malloc(sizeof(int)), free); // ok
</description>
<suggestion></suggestion>
<notes>Agree. The unique_ptr(pointer 
p) <em>Requires</em> clause should be the same as the unique_ptr() <em>
Requires</em> clause. Note that unique_ptr [unique.ptr] needs concepts.

        chrono::duration is missing the modulous operator for both
        member and non-member arithmetic. This operator is useful
        for finding the position of a duration within a bounded
        time frame. Having it be built in to duration is safer than
        requiring the client to extract and operate directly on the
        duration&#8217;s representation as the latter will not
        enforce the correct units of the operation.
        <BR/>

        The identity
        "&amp;*(s.begin() + n) == &amp;*s.begin() + n" relies on
        operator&amp; doing the "right thing", which (AFAICS) there
        is no requirement for. See my comment under clauses
        "23.2.1, 23.2.6" (p1 in both cases) - this is the same
        issue, but I've created a separate comment for basic_string
        because it is in a different chapter.

        The
        operator&lt;&lt; for basic_string takes the output stream
        by r-value reference. This is different from the same
        operator for error_code (19.4.2.6), bitset (20.2.6.3),
        shared_ptr (20.7.13.2.8), complex (26.3.6) and sub_match
        (28.4)
</description>
<suggestion>
        Use the same reference type for the all the
        library types. This should be the r-value reference. There
        are other places in the standard where TR1, and new
        classes, did not receive an 'R-value' update.
</suggestion>
<notes>We did it differently for basic_string because otherwise rvalue streaming 
    was producing confusing results with strings, but this difference will be 
    fixed by N2831 if it's accepted.</notes>
<rationale>
N2844 changed the rvalue reference binding rules. That paper includes generic templates operator&lt;&lt; and operator&gt;&gt; that adapt rvalue streams.

        <tt>codecvt_byname is only specified to work with locale
        names. There is no built-in means to find a codecvt with a
        character set's name. A locale and a character set are not
        the same. If the user has data which is encoded in a
        certain character set and she wants to create a codecvt
        which can convert from that character set to another one,
        she must iterate through locales to find one, or use
        external means (iconv, ICU's uconv). Specifying a locale
        with the character set is not a suitable solution, since
        there is no built-in mapping from character sets to
        locales. It is only possible to inquire the character set
        once the locale is known.</tt>

        It is not clear
        what purpose the Requirement tables serve in the Containers
        clause. Are they the definition of a library Container? Or
        simply a conventient shorthand to factor common semantics
        into a single place, simplifying the description of each
        subsequent container? This becomes an issue for
        'containers' like array, which does not meet the
        default-construct-to-empty requirement, or forward_list
        which does not support the size operation. Are these
        components no longer containers? Does that mean the
        remaining requirements don't apply? Or are these
        contradictions that need fixing, despite being a clear
        design decision?
</description>
<suggestion>
        Clarify all the tables in 23.1 are there as
        a convenience for documentation, rather than a strict set
        of requirements. Containers should be allowed to relax
        specific requirements if they call attention to them in
        their documentation. The introductory text for array should
        be expanded to mention a default constructed array is not
        empty, and forward_list introduction should mention it does
        not provide the required size operation as it cannot be
        implemented efficiently.
</suggestion>
<notes>Agree in principle. We suggest proposed wording:</notes>

        Leaving it
        unspecified whether or not iterator and const_iterator are
        the same type is dangerous, as user code may or may not
        violate the One Definition Rule by providing overloads for
        both types. It is probably too late to specify a single
        behaviour, but implementors should document what to expect.
        Observing that problems can be avoided by users restricting
        themselves to using const_iterator, add a note to that
        effect.

        The axiom

        value, not just iterators that dereference to the same
        value. This is a similar statement that is easier to
        express and should be equivalent - the idea that insert and
        emplace might return iterator values that do not compare
        equal but point to the same element should fail somewhere
        in the iterator concepts. Also, this axiom should be

        actually applies to string also, but that's a different
        chapter, so I'll file a separate comment there and
        cross-reference).

<suggestion>
        Define a ContiguousStrorage and apply it to
        vector,array and string. The Concept (supplied by Alisdair
        M) looks like this: Concept&lt; typename C &gt;
        ContiguousStrorage { requires Container&lt;C&gt;; typename
        value_type = C::value_type; value_type * data( C ); axiom
        Contiguous { C c; true = equal_ranges( data( c), data(c) +
        size(c), begin(c)); } };

        The predicate types used in special member
        function of forward_list should be CopyConstructible, as
        per the algorithms of the same name. Note: an alternate
        solution would be to require these callable concepts to be
        CopyConstructible in clause 20, which would simplify the
        library specification in general. See earlier comment for
        details, that would render this one redundant.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add
        CopyConstructible requirement to the following signatures:
        template &lt;Predicate&lt;auto, T&gt; Pred&gt; requires
        CopyConstructible&lt;Pred&gt; void remove_if(Pred pred);
        template &lt;EquivalenceRelation&lt;auto, T&gt;
        BinaryPredicate&gt; requires
        CopyConstructible&lt;BinaryPredicate&gt; void
        unique(BinaryPredicate binary_pred); template
        &lt;StrictWeakOrder&lt;auto, T&gt; Compare&gt; requires
        CopyConstructible&lt;Compare&gt; void
        merge(forward_list&lt;T,Alloc&gt;&amp;&amp; x, Compare
        comp); template &lt;StrictWeakOrder&lt;auto, T&gt;

        The content of

        that we have Concepts. As such, the desctiption is more

        Iterator

        The text "so for

        past the last element of a corresponding container" is
        slightly misleading. Iterators can refer into generalised
        ranges and sequences, not just containers. A broader term

        The
        post-increment operator is dangerous for a general
        InputIterator. The multi-pass guarantees that make it
        meaningful are defined as part of the ForwardIterator
        refinement. Any change will affect only constrained
        templates that have not yet been written, so should not
        break existing user iterators which remain free to add
        these operations. This change will also affect the
        generalised OutputIterator, although there is no percieved
        need for the post-increment operator in this case either.

        the following code generates an error.
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        template &lt;std::Range Rng&gt;
        <BR/>
        void sort(Rng&amp; r)
        <BR/>{
        <BR/>
        // error! Rng::iterator does not satisfy requirements of a
        random
        <BR/>
        // access iterator.
        <BR/>
        std::sort(begin(r), end(r));
        <BR/>}
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v; // vector::iterator is a random
        access iterator.
        <BR/>
        sort(v);
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        This is because the concept of an iterator of std::Range is
        InputIterator. For this reason, a random access iterator
        loses its capability when passed to a std::Range parameter.
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>To
        be able to work the above code, we need to write as
        follows:
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        template &lt;std::Range T&gt;
        <BR/>
        requires std::RandomAccessIterator&lt;T::iterator&gt;
        &amp;&amp;
        <BR/>
        std::ShuffleIterator&lt;T::iterator&gt; &amp;&amp;
        <BR/>
        std::LessThanComparable&lt;T::iterator::value_type&gt;
        <BR/>
        void sort(T&amp; r)
        <BR/>{
        <BR/>
        sort(begin(r), end(r));
        <BR/>}
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
        <BR/>
        sort(v);
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>It
        needs quiet a few amount of codes like this only to recover
        random access capability from InputIterator concept.
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>We
        can write the following valid code with Boost.Range, which
        is implemented with using C++03 SFINAE.
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        template &lt;class Range&gt;
        <BR/>
        void sort(Range&amp; r)
        <BR/>{
        <BR/>
        std::sort(boost::begin(r), boost::end(r));
        <BR/>}
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
        <BR/>
        sort(v); // OK
        <BR/>
        
        <BR/>One of the
        motivation to introduce concepts are supporting template
        programming techniques by language directly to eliminate
        hacky techniques such as tag-dispatch, SFINAE and Type
        Traints. But SFINAE will be kept using because it needs
        quite a few amount of codes without using SFAINAE.

        reverse_iterator
        and move_iterator use different formulations for their
        comparison operations. move_iterator merely requires the
        minimal set of operations, &lt; and ==, from its underlying
        iterator and synthesizes all oprations from these two.
        reverse_iterator relies on the undelying iterator to
        support all comparision operations directly. In practice,
        move_iterator can only be implemented this way as it must
        support iterator types that are merely InputIterators, and
        so SemiRegular and not Regular. However, reserse_iterator
        has an existing specification and any change of semantic
        could change behaviour of conforming programs today -
        although an iterator that yields different results for (a
        &gt; b) than (b &lt; a) may fall foul of some semantic
        consistency requirements, even if the syntax is met.
</description>

        operations using only operators &lt; and ==, as per the

        The default
        constructor default-initializes current, rather than
        value-initializes. This means that when Iterator
        corresponds to a trivial type, the current member is left
        un-initialized, even when the user explictly requests value
        intialization! At this point, it is not safe to perform any
        operations on the reverse_iterator other than assign it a
        new value or destroy it. Note that this does correspond to
        the basic definition of a singular iterator.

        It is very hard
        to pick up the correct specification for
        istream_iterator::operator== as the complete specification
        requires reading two quite disconnected paragraphs,
        24.5.1p3, and 24.5.1.2p6. Reading just the specifaction of
        the operation itself suggests that end-of-stream iterators
        are indistinguishable from 'valid' stream iterators, which
        is a very dangerous misreading.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Merge 24.5.1p3, equality comparison of

The opening paragraphs give an overview; the Returns: clause for

        The listed paragraphs redundantly redefine
        an input iterator, and redundancy can be a dangerous thing
        in a specification. Suggest a simpler phrasing below.

        2. The result of
        operator*() on an end of stream is undefined. For any other
        iterator value a char_type value is returned. 3. Two end of
        stream iterators are always equal. An end of stream
        iterator is not equal to a non-end of stream iterator. 4.
        As istreambuf_iterator() is an InputIterator but not a
        ForwardIterator, istreambuf_iterators object can be used
        only for one-pass algorithms. It is not possible to assign
        a character via an input iterator.

        THere is a level
        of redundancy in the library specification for many
        algorithms that can be eliminated with the combination of
        concepts and default parameters for function templates.
        Eliminating redundancy simplified specification and reduces
        the risk of inttroducing accidental inconsistencies.

        The return types of is_sorted_until function and

        Since publishing
        the original standard, we have learned that swap is a
        fundamental operation, and several common idioms rely on it
        - especially those related to exception safety. As such it
        belongs in the common &lt;utility&gt; header rather than
        the broader &lt;algorithm&gt; header, and likewise should
        move to clause 20. For backwards compatiblility the
        algorithm header should be required to #include
        &lt;utility&gt;, which would be covered in the resolution
        of LWG issue 343. There are already dependencies in
        &lt;algorithm&gt; on types declared in this header, so this
        comment does not create a new dependency.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Move primary swap template from
        &lt;algorithm&gt; into &lt;utility&gt;. Move 25.2.3 to
        somewhere under 20.2. Require &lt;algorithm&gt; to #include
        &lt;utility&gt; to access pair and provide legacy support
        for finding swap.

The paragraph describes something different. is_partitioned takes a
predicate; "partitioned with respect to an expression" deals with an
expression. While it's possible to wrap an expresion in a predicate,
that would result in a circumlocution in the places where "partitioned
with respect to an expression" is used.

<description>
        The swap
        overloads for regex classes are only supplied for l-value
        references. Other sections of the library (eg 21 strings or
        23 containers) provide two extra overloads taking an
        r-value reference as the first and second argument
        respectively.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add the missing overloads to 28.4 and the

        It was always expected that
        regex_token_iterator would be constructible from an array
        literal: indeed ideally this is the prefered method of
        initializing such an object. However, the best we could do
        in C++0x was: template &lt;std::size_t N&gt;
        regex_token_iterator(BidirectionalIterator a,
        BidirectionalIterator b, const regex_type&amp; re, const
        int (&amp;submatches)[N], regex_constants::match_flag_type
        m = regex_constants::match_default); Now that we have
        initializer_lists we should use them to remove this
        particular wart.
</description>
<suggestion>
        To the synopsis
        for regex_token_iterator, after template &lt;std::size_t
        N&gt; regex_token_iterator(BidirectionalIterator a,
        BidirectionalIterator b, const regex_type&amp; re, const
        int (&amp;submatches)[N], regex_constants::match_flag_type
        m = regex_constants::match_default); add
        regex_token_iterator(BidirectionalIterator a,
        BidirectionalIterator b, const regex_type&amp; re,
        initializer_list&lt;int&gt; submatches,
        regex_constants::match_flag_type m =
        regex_constants::match_default); In 28.12.2.1 add the
        declaration: regex_token_iterator(BidirectionalIterator a,
        BidirectionalIterator b, const regex_type&amp; re,
        initializer_list&lt;int&gt; submatches,
        regex_constants::match_flag_type m =
        regex_constants::match_default); And to the end of para 3
        add: The forth constructor initializes the member subs to
        hold a copy of the sequence of integer values in the range
        [submatches.begin(), submatches.end()).

        The contents of the &lt;stdatomic.h&gt;
        header are not listed anywhere, and &lt;cstdatomic&gt; is
        listed as a C99 header in chapter 17. If we intend to use
        these for compatibility with a future C standard, we should
        not use them now.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Remove &lt;cstdatomic&gt; from the C99
        headers in table 14. Add a new header &lt;atomic&gt; to the
        headers in table 13. Update chapter 29 to remove reference
        to &lt;stdatomic.h&gt; and replace the use of
        &lt;cstdatomic&gt; with &lt;atomic&gt;. If and when WG14
        adds atomic operations to C we can add corresponding
        headers to table 14 with a TR.

        Throughout this
        clause, the term Requires: is used to introduce compile
        time requirements, which we expect to be replaced with
        concepts and requires in code. Run-time preconditions are
        introduced with the term "Preconditions:" which is not a
        defined part of the library documentation structure
        (17.5.2.4). However, this is exactly the direction that BSI

        The presence of
        a non-explicit variadic template constructor alongside an
        explicit single-argument constructor can lead to behaviour
        that is not intended: the variadic constructor will be
        selected for implicit conversions, defeating the purpose of
        the explicit single-argument constructor. Additionally the
        single-argument constructor is redundant; the variadic
        constructor can provide identical functionality with one
        *fewer* copies if the supplied func is an lvalue.

        Mark constructor template &lt;class F,
        class ...Args&gt; thread(F&amp;&amp; f, Args&amp;&amp;...

        The precondition
        that the mutex is not owned by this thread offers
        introduces the risk of un-necessary undefined behaviour
        into the program. The only time it matters whether the
        current thread owns the mutex is in the lock operation, and
        that will happen subsequent to construction in this case.
        The lock operation has the identical pre-condition, so
        there is nothing gained by asserting that precondition
        earlier and denying the program the right to get into a
        valid state before calling lock.

<description>
        Not clear what
        the specification for error condition
        resource_deadlock_would_occur means. It is perfectly
        possible for this thread to own the mutex without setting
        owns to true on this specific lock object. It is also
        possible for lock operations to succeed even if the thread
        does own the mutex, if the mutex is recursive. Likewise, if
        the mutex is not recursive and the mutex has been locked
        externally, it is not always possible to know that this
        error condition should be raised, depending on the host
        operating system facilities. It is possible that 'i.e.' was
        supposed to be 'e.g.' and that suggests that recursive
        locks are not allowed. That makes sense, as the
        exposition-only member owns is boolean and not a integer to
        count recursive locks.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add a precondition !owns. Change the 'i.e.'
        in the error condition to be 'e.g.' to allow for this
        condition to propogate deadlock detection by the host OS.
</suggestion>
<notes>Create an issue. Assigned to Lawrence Crowl. Note: not sure what try_lock 
    means for recursive locks when you are the owner. POSIX has language on 
    this, which should ideally be followed. Proposed fix is not quite right, for 
    example, try_lock should have different wording from lock.</notes>

        future, promise and packaged_task provide a
        framework for creating future values, but a simple function
        to tie all three components together is missing. Note that
        we only need a *simple* facility for C++0x. Advanced thread
        pools are to be left for TR2.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Provide a simple
        function along the lines of: template&lt; typename F,
        typename ... Args &gt; requires Callable&lt; F, Args...
        &gt; future&lt; Callable::result_type &gt; async(
        F&amp;&amp; f, Args &amp;&amp; ... ); Semantics are similar
        to creating a thread object with a packaged_task invoking f
        with forward&lt;Args&gt;(args...) but details are left
        unspecified to allow different scheduling and thread
        spawning implementations. It is unspecified whether a task
        submitted to async is run on its own thread or a thread
        previously used for another async task. If a call to async
        succeeds, it shall be safe to wait for it from any thread.
        The state of thread_local variables shall be preserved
        during async calls. No two incomplete async tasks shall see
        the same value of this_thread::get_id(). [Note: this
        effectively forces new tasks to be run on a new thread, or
        a fixed-size pool with no queue. If the library is unable
        to spawn a new thread or there are no free worker threads
        then the async call should fail.]
</suggestion>
<notes>

The concurrency subgroup has revisited this issue and decided
that it could be considered a defect according to the Kona
compromise. A task group was formed led by Lawrence Crowl
(crowl@google.com) and Bjarne Stroustrup (bs@cs.tamu.edu) to
write a paper for Frankfurt proposing a simple asynchronous
launch facility returning a future. It was agreed that the
callable must be run on a separate thread from the caller, but
not necessarily a brand-new thread. The proposal might or might
not allow for an implementation that uses fixed-size or unlimited
thread pools.<BR/><BR/>
Bjarne in c++std-lib-23121: I think that what we agreed was that
to avoid deadlock async() would almost certainly be specified to
launch in a different thread from the thread that executed
async(), but I don't think it was a specific design constraint.

        It is possible
        to transfer ownership of the asynchronous result from one
        unique_future instance to another via the move-constructor.
        However, it is not possible to transfer it back, and nor is
        it possible to create a default-constructed unique_future
        instance to use as a later move target. This unduly limits
        the use of unique_future in code. Also, the lack of a
        move-assignment operator restricts the use of unique_future
        in containers such as std::vector - vector::insert requires
        move-assignable for example.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add a default constructor with the
        semantics that it creates a unique_future with no
        associated asynchronous result. Add a move-assignment
        operator which transfers ownership.

        shared_future
        should support an efficient move constructor that can avoid

        shared_future is currently
        CopyConstructible, but not CopyAssignable. This is
        inconsistent with shared_ptr, and will surprise users.
        Users will then write work-arounds to provide this
        behaviour. We should provide it simply and efficiently as
        part of shared_future. Note that since the shared_future
        member functions for accessing the state are all declared
        const, the original usage of an immutable shared_future
        value that can be freely copied by multiple threads can be
        retained by declaring such an instance as "const
        shared_future".
</description>
<suggestion>
        Remove "=delete"
        from the copy-assignment operator of shared_future. Add a
        move-constructor shared_future(shared_future&amp;&amp;
        rhs), and a move-assignment operator shared_future&amp;
        operator=(shared_future&amp;&amp; rhs). The postcondition
        for the copy-assignment operator is that *this has the same
        associated state as rhs. The postcondition for the
        move-constructor and move assignment is that *this has the
        same associated as rhs had before the
        constructor/assignment call and that rhs has no associated
        state.

        There is an

        The move constructor of a std::promise
        object does not need to allocate any memory, so the
        move-construct-with-allocator overload of the constructor
        is superfluous.

        Remove the
        constructor with the signature template &lt;class

        Specifying a minimum of 17 recursively nested template
        instantiations is too small for practical purposes. The
        limit is too high to effectively limit compiler resource
        usage, see
        http://ubiety.uwaterloo.ca/~tveldhui/papers/2003/turing.pdf
        . The conclusion is that the metric "number of recursively

        It is desirable to allow some mechanism to
        support phasing out of deprecated features in the future.
        Allowing compilers to implement a mode where deprecated
        features are not available is a good first step.
</description>
<suggestion>
        Add to the definition of deprecated
        features permission for compilers to maintain a
        conditionally supported mode where deprecated features can
        be disabled, so long as they also default to a mode where
        all deprecated features are supported.
</suggestion>
<notes>Deals with deprecation, needs to be discussed in general group. Attention:
