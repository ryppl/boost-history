<p>
This example compares <code>thread::get_id</code> with <code>this_thread::get_id</code>, and how  
it plays with <code>detach()</code>.  In one spot <code>main</code> attempts to move a <code>std::thread</code>
from itself to another scope.  Because my <code>bind</code> and <code>tuple</code> haven't been  
"moved" yet, I had to fake it with an ugly <code>std::ref</code> followed by an  
inappropriate move.
</p>
<p>
If one follows the output and source together, as if you were a human  
source-level debugger, the logic should become clear.    Also note  
that <code>detach</code> is used (twice!) and process termination is guaranteed to  
be orderly (in this example).
