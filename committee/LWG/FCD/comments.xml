The threading model does not make basic guarantees
needed to write correct programs. We should not repeat
the error that POSIX made in early standards (and later
corrected).

<suggestion>
Add requirements that all no-blocked threads will
(however slowly) make progress and that all
visible side effects will (eventually) be seen by
other threads. Possibly use the word &#8220;should&#8221; if
an absolute requirement is impossible.

There are core issues surrounding the undefined behavior
of dereferencing a null pointer. It appears the intent is that
dereferencing *is* well defined, but using the result of the
dereference will yield undefined behavior. This topic is too
confused to be the reference example of undefined
behavior, or should be stated more precisely if it is to be
retained.

From a naive, first-time reader's point of view, 1.9.6 made
me double take, as it seemed it could imply any signal
would leave the program in an unspecified state after
completing. I believe I understand the intent, but to clarify
it, I'd change it to make it clear that the unspecified state
applies only for the duration of the signal handler.

interrupted by receipt of a signal, the values of
objects which are neither
of type volatile std::sig_atomic_t nor
lock-free atomic objects (29.4)
are unspecified, and the value of any object not in
either of these two categories that is modified by
the handler becomes undefined.

Initialisation of atomics

Add the following to 1.10p4:

[ Note: There may be non-atomic writes to atomic
objects, for example on initialization and reinitialization.
- end note]

Rationale: We believe the intent is that for any atomic
there is a distinguished initialisation write, but that this
need not happens-before all the other operations on that
atomic - specifically so that the initialisation write might be
non-atomic and hence give rise to a data race, and hence
undefined behaviour, in examples such as this (from
Hans):
<PRE>
atomic&lt; atomic&lt;int&gt; * &gt; p
f()                    |
{ atomic&lt;int&gt;x;        | W_na x
  p.store(&amp;x,mo_rlx);  | W_rlx p=&amp;x
}                      |
</PRE>
(where na is nonatomic and rlx is relaxed). We suspect
also that no other mixed atomic/nonatomic access to the
same location is intended to be permitted. The possibility
of non-atomic writes on atomic objects is not mentioned in
1.10, and (before talking with Hans) we didn't realise it
was intended, so we suggest adding the note above to
clarify things.

The use of maximal in the definition of release sequence
(proposed edit seems reasonable to Clark)<BR/>
We suggest that 1.10p6 be changed to:<BR/>
A release sequence from a release operation A on an
atomic object M is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence
of side effects in the modification order of M, where
the first operation is A, and every subsequent
operation<BR/>
- is performed by the same thread that performed
the release, or<BR/>
- is an atomic read-modify-write operation.<BR/>
Rationale: The current wording of the standard suggests
that release sequences are maximal with respect to
sequence inclusion, i.e. that if there are two release
operations in the modification order,<BR/>
<PRE>
mod       mod
rel1-----&gt;rel2-----&gt;w
</PRE>
then [rel1;rel2;w] is the only release sequence, as the
other candidate [rel2;w] is included in it. This interpretation
precludes synchronizing with releases which have other
releases sequenced-before them. We believe that the
intention is actually to define the maximal release
sequence from a particular release operation, which would
admit both [rel1;rel2;w] and [rel2;w].</description>

Reading from the last element in a vsse?
Paul wrote:<BR/>
&gt; If every element in a vsse happens-before a given value<BR/>
&gt; computation, then that value computation must return<BR/>
&gt; the value stored by the last element in the vsse.<BR/>
We wrote:<BR/>
We're not sure about that. Consider the following, with two
relaxed writes to x on one thread that are not sequencedbefore
related to each other (eg in different arguments to
the same function), but are followed by a release/acquire
on a different variable y to another thread that then reads
x. We think the final read (e) could read from either (a) or
(b), regardless of how (a) and (b) are related in
modification order.
<PRE>
a:Wrlx x=1   b:Wrlx x=2
      \     /
     sb\   /sb

        c:Wrel y-----------

                            \

                             |
                         e:Rrlx x=?
</PRE>
|
Paul&gt; In that case IIRC, the standard does not specify<BR/>
Paul&gt; the order, but the code will be generated in some<BR/>
Paul&gt; order, and that arbitrary choice on the part of the<BR/>
Paul&gt; compiler will determine the modification order.<BR/>
We agree that in a normal implementation (eg where the<BR/>
argument evaluations are not spawned off to new threads
- is that intended to be forbidden?), the two writes will
indeed be ordered according to the generated-code order
(and before the release fence), and hardware coherence
will ensure that (e) reads the later one.<BR/>
But in the draft standard as written, that execution is
allowed - the draft doesn't currently impose that aspect of
coherence. To make the example more concrete, if there
were another thread with<BR/>
<PRE>
c --sw--&gt; f:Racq y --sb--&gt; g:Rrlx x
</PRE>
then e and g could read different values.<BR/>
Paul notes:<BR/>
&gt; But 1.10p1 says:<BR/>
&gt;<BR/>
&gt; A thread of execution (also known as a thread) is a<BR/>
&gt; single flow of control within a program, including<BR/>
&gt; the initial invocation of a specific top-level<BR/>
&gt; function, and recursively including every function<BR/>
&gt; invocation subsequently executed by the thread.<BR/>
&gt;<BR/>
&gt; This excludes the possibility of the implementation<BR/>
&gt; spawing off a new thread -unless- the implementation<BR/>
&gt; can make things appear as if there was only one thread.<BR/>
&gt; From this viewpoint, your example shows just how<BR/>
&gt; careful an implementation must be if it is to fully<BR/>
&gt; comply with this as-if rule.<BR/>
We replied<BR/>
&gt;ok, thanks<BR/>
to this, but in fact the situation is still unclear.<BR/>
1.10p1 does indeed rule out the hypothetical
implementation that we mentioned, but even if (a) and (b)
would be ordered by any reasonable implementation, in
terms of the concepts of the standard, that doesn't
introduce a sequenced-before edge between (a) and (b).<BR/>
It seems that Paul is assuming the individual memory
accesses in function arguments are indeterminately
sequenced rather than unsequenced?

Alternative definition of the value read by an atomic
operation<BR/>
Here's an interesting example involving a
release/consume pair. We believe that in a direct
implementation on hardware, this would be forbidden by
coherence, but that the current text allows it. We don't
know whether it should be allowed or not.
<PRE>
            hb
            do
            rf
Wx_release ----&gt; Rx_consume
         ^         |
          \        |sb,hb
        mo \       v
             --- Wx_release
</PRE>
Paul claims this is forbidden by 1.10p5, but we don't see
how that can be the case. We don't see much room in
1.10p5 for any other interpretation - it says:<BR/>
- "All modifications to a particular atomic object M occur in
some particular total order, called the modification order of
M"<BR/>
- "If A and B are modifications of an atomic object M and
A happens before (as defined below) B, then A shall
precede B in the modification order of M, which is defined
below."<BR/>
Both of which seem very clear. The only wiggle room is in
the Note<BR/>
- "[Note: This states that the modification orders must
respect the "happens before" relationship]"<BR/>
We took that "must respect" to be a gloss rather than to
add any additional constraint.<BR/>
Earlier we suggested a change, to the constraint on the
value read by an atomic operation, that would forbid this
example:<BR/>
The standard introduces visible side effects, which are
used first to define the values read by non-atomic
operations. They are then re-used to constrain the value
read by atomic operations: 1.10p13 says that an atomic
operation must read from somewhere in "the" visible
sequence of side effects, which must start from *a* visible
side effect, i.e. a side effect that (a) happens before the
read, and (b) is not happens-before-hidden. We suspect
that this re-use of the notion of visible side effect may be a
drafting artifact, in which case one might remove the
requirement that there is a vse for atomics, and replacing
the first two sentences of 1.10p13 by<BR/>
"An atomic operation must read from somewhere in the
modification order that is not happens-before-hidden
and does not follow (in modification order) any side
effect that happens-after the read."BR/&gt;
Now we're not sure how this would fit in with initialisation
and reading of indeterminate values; we need to think
about it more.

Control dependencies for atomics<BR/>
Given the examples of compilers interchanging data and
control dependencies, and that control dependencies are
architecturally respected on Power/ARM for load-&gt;store
(and on Power for load-&gt;load with a relatively cheap
isync), we're not sure why carries-a-dependency-to does
not include control dependencies between atomics.

At the time that the memory model was formulated, there
was considerable uncertainty as to what architectures
respect control dependencies, and to what extent. It
appears that this uncertainty is being cleared up, and
our hope is that it will be ripe for standardization in
a later TR.

Intra-thread dependency-ordered-before<BR/>
The current draft has release/acquire synchronize-with
edges only between a release on one thread and an
acquire on a *different* thread, whereas the definition of
dependency-ordered-before permits the release and
consume to be on the same thread; it seems odd to permit
the latter. (At the moment function arguments can't race or
sync with each other, but they can be dependency
ordered before each other.)<BR/>
We don't currently have an example in which this makes a
real difference, but for symmetry could suggest changing
the definition of dependency-ordered-before in 1.10p9 to
the following:<BR/>
An evaluation A is dependency-ordered before an
evaluation B if<BR/>
- A performs a release operation on an atomic object
M, and on another thread, B performs a consume
operation on M and reads a value written by any
side effect in the release sequence headed by A,<BR/>
or<BR/>
- for some evaluation X, A is dependency-ordered
before X and X carries a dependency to B.

The reference really should be to "data races as defined
in this International Standard", because the note compares
this definition with the generally-understood meaning of
data races in sequentially-consistent executions. That's
far too stilted, and "as defined here" seems like a
reasonable way to phrase it in the less formal context of
a note.

Wording of the read-read coherence condition<BR/>
In 1.10p13 a coherence condition is stated on the values
of atomic reads:<BR/>
"Furthermore, if a value computation A of an atomic
object M happens before a value computation B of M,
and the value computed by A corresponds to the value
stored by side effect X, then the value computed by B
shall either equal the value computed by A, or be the
value stored by side effect Y, where Y follows X in
the modification order of M."<BR/>
We suggest that this be replaced with the following:<BR/>
"Furthermore, if a value computation A of an atomic
object M happens before a value computation B of M,
and A takes its value from the side effect X, then
the value computed by B shall either be the value
stored by X, or the value stored by a side effect Y,
where Y follows X in the modification order of M."<BR/>
Rationale: The words "corresponds to" are not used
elsewhere in the standard, as far as we can see, and it is
unclear whether they have a special meaning here. In
addition taking the value of the read B from the value read
by A seems unnecessarily indirect. B could take its value
from X instead.

Non-unique visible sequences of side effects and
happens-before ordering<BR/>
In 1.10p13, replace<BR/>
"The visible sequence of side effects on..." by
"A visible sequence of side effects on..."<BR/>
and<BR/>
"in the visible sequence of M with respect to B" by
"in a visible sequence of M with respect to B"<BR/>
Rationale: the current standard allows multiple visible
sequences of side effects (vsse's) for a given read
(despite the use of "The" at the start of 1.10p13). We
demonstrate this by constructing an execution with two
vsse's. The following execution has five memory
operations, four of which are read modify writes (RMW's).
There are two threads, one with four operations each
ordered by sequenced before (sb), the other with a single
RMW release.
<PRE>
RMW1             +---RMW3_release
|               /
|sb          do/
v             /
R_consume&lt;---+
|
|sb
v
RMW2
|
|sb
v
RMW4
</PRE>
The modification order in this example is as
follows:
<PRE>
mod       mod               mod
RMW1-----&gt;RMW2-----&gt;RMW3_release-----&gt;RMW4
</PRE>
With the modification order we give above, the
happens-before relation
has exactly these edges, according to 1.10p10:
<PRE>
From sequenced-before:
RMW1      -&gt; R_consume, RMW2, RMW4
R_consume -&gt; RMW2, RMW4
RMW2      -&gt; RMW4
From ithb:
From dependency-ordered-before:
RMW3_release -&gt; R_consume
</PRE>
In particular, there are no edges
<PRE>
RMW3_release -&gt; RMW2 or RMW4.
</PRE>
As we understand it, this is the intended
absence of transitivity from dependency-orderedbefore
to sequenced-before.<BR/>
1.10p5 says that if A happens-before B then A precedes B
in the modification order, which is true for all the happensbefore
edges and the modification order above.<BR/>
RMW1 and RMW3_release are visible side effects<BR/>
RMW2 and RMW4 follow R_consume in happens-before,
so cannot be in a visible sequence of side effects.<BR/>
Hence the two visible sequences of side effects are
[RMW1] and [RMW3].<BR/>
The R_consume here must read from the later vsse in
modification order for the dependency_ordered edge to
exist. The existence of two vsse's relies on the lack of
transitivity of happens before (which only occurs in the
presence of consume operations).

effects on..."<BR/>

The definition of a data race does not take into account

Augment the first sentence:<BR/>
The execution of a program contains a data race if

threads, at least one of which is not atomic <ins>(or
both are atomic and operate on overlapping, but
not-identical, memory locations)</ins>, and neither

<rationale>
The premise is incorrect; atomic objects may not
overlap. The type argument to the atomic template
must be a trivially-copyable type (29.5.3p1) and
atomic objects are not trivially copyable. The atomic
types provide no means to obtain a reference to
internal members; all atomic operations are
copy-in/copy-out. In short, any attempt to generate a
pair of atomic variables whose memory overlaps results
in undefined behavior.

The text says that the library "provides ... operations on
locks". It should say "operations on mutexes", since it is
the mutexes that provide the synchronization. A lock is
just an abstract concept (though the library types
unique_lock and lock_guard model ownership of locks)
and as such cannot have operations performed on it. This
mistake is carried through in the notes in that paragraph
and in 1.10p7
</description>
<suggestion>
Change 1.10p4 as follows:<BR/>
"The library defines a number of atomic
operations (Clause 29) and operations on
mutexes (Clause 30) that are specially identified
as synchronization operations. These operations
play a special role in making assignments in one
thread visible to another. A synchronization
operation on one or more memory locations
is either a consume operation, an acquire
operation, a release operation, or both an acquire
and release operation. A synchronization
operation without an associated memory location
is a fence and can be either an acquire fence, a
release fence, or both an acquire and release
fence. In addition, there are relaxed atomic
operations, which are not synchronization
operations, and atomic read-modify-write
operations, which have special characteristics. [
Note: For example, a call that acquires a lock on a
mutex will perform an acquire operation on the
locations comprising the mutex. Correspondingly,
a call that releases the same lock will perform a
release operation on those same locations.
Informally, performing a release operation on A
forces prior side effects on other memory
locations to become visible to other threads that
later perform a consume or an acquire operation
on A. &#8220;Relaxed&#8221; atomic operations are not
synchronization operations even though, like
synchronization operations, they cannot contribute
to data races.  end note ]"<BR/>
Change 1.10p7 as follows:<BR/>
"Certain library calls synchronize with other library
calls performed by another thread. In particular,
an atomic operation A that performs a release
operation on an atomic object M synchronizes
with an atomic operation B that performs an
acquire operation on M and reads a value written
by any side effect in the release sequence headed
by A. [ Note: Except in the specified cases,
reading a later value does not necessarily ensure
visibility as described below. Such a requirement
would sometimes interfere with efficient
implementation.  end note ] [ Note: The
specifications of the synchronization operations
define when one reads the value written by
another. For atomic objects, the definition is clear.
All operations on a given mutex occur in a single
total order. Each lock acquisition &#8220;reads the value
written&#8221; by the last lock release on the same
mutex.  &#8212;end note ]"

We agree that if the read from x reads the value written by
the write to
x the write to x inter-thread-happens-before the write to y.
However, the read from y is sequenced before the write to
x, so if the
read from x reads the value written by the write to x, then
the read
from y also inter-thread-happens-before the write to y.
Consequently,
the read from y cannot see the value written by the write
to y.
The reciprocal ordering also applies, but they cannot both
apply in the
same execution since if the write to x happens-before the
read from x
then the read from y happens-before the write to y, and
vice-versa.
There is thus no contradiction.

(c) RMW1, RMW2, RMW3, RMW4.<BR/>

since RMW1, RMW2 and RMW4 occur in a single thread
in that sequence, and
RMW3 occurs in a separate thread with no other ordering
constraints.
Since the R_consume lies between RMW1 and RMW2 in
that thread, it must
either read the value written by RMW1 (which could
happen if it
immediately follows RMW1 in any of the sequences), or
RMW3 (which could
happen with sequence (b)).
The visible sequence of side effects for R_consume is
thus either RMW3,
RMW1 (from (a)), RMW1 (from (b), (c) or (d)), or RMW1,
RMW3 (from (b)).
Which sequence applies in practice may vary from
execution to execution.
There is however only a single sequence on any given
execution.

The read is sequenced-before the write in the same

At the time that the memory model was formulated,
there was considerable uncertainty as to what
architectures respect control dependencies, and to
what extent. It appears that this uncertainty is
being cleared up, and our hope is that it will be
ripe for standardization in a later TR.

Precedence of reversal and tokenization<BR/>
The current paper implies that determination of the
characters forming an r-char-sequence occurs while the
transformations done in phase 1 and phase 2 are still in
effect.<BR/>
Consider these cases:<BR/>
<UL><LI> Line splicing occurred in translation phase 2; the
backslash is not there on entry to phase 3 when
we try to tokenize:<BR/>
const char str[] = R"a()\a")a";</LI>
<LI> Trigraph replacement occurred in phase 1. The
right parenthesis is not there on entry to phase 3:<BR/>
const char str[] = R"(??)";</LI>
<LI> Trigraph replacement (again). In [lex.string]
paragraph 2, there is a footnote 24 in N3092.
Note that this provides fuel for anti-trigraph
sentiment:<BR/>
const char str[] = R"#()??=")#";</LI></UL>
Change in [lex.string] from N3077:<BR/>
Escape sequences and universal-character-names
in non-raw string literals have the same
meaning as in character literals ....<BR/>
should be reflected in [lex.phases] paragraph 1, phase 5
(CD2 wording):<BR/>
Each source character set member and universal-character-name
in a character literal or a string literal, as
well as each escape sequence in a character literal or a
non-raw string literal, is converted to the corresponding
member of the execution character set (2.14.3, 2.14.5); if
there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an
implementation-defined member other than the null (wide)
character<BR/>
and [lex.charset] paragraph 2 (CD2 wording):<BR/>
Additionally, if the hexadecimal value for a universal-character-name
outside the <I>c-char-sequence</I>, <I>s-char-sequence</I>,
or <I>r-char-sequence</I> of a character or string
literal corresponds to a control character (in either of the
ranges 0x00-0x1F or 0x7F-0x9F, both inclusive) or to a
character in the basic source character set, the program is
ill-formed.<BR/>
UCNs simply do not occur in the grammar for r-char-sequence
anyway.
</description>
<suggestion>
In 2.14.5 [lex.string] paragraph 2: Remove
footnote 24:<BR/>
In 2.2 [lex.phases] paragraph 1, phase 1; insert
exception:<BR/>
Physical source file characters are
mapped, in an implementation-defined
manner, to the basic source character
set (introducing new-line characters for
end-of-line indicators) if necessary. The
set of physical source file characters
accepted is implementation-defined.
Trigraph sequences (2.4) are replaced by
corresponding single-character internal
representations. Any source file
character not in the basic source
character set (2.3) is replaced by the
universal-character-name that
designates that character. (An
implementation may use any internal
encoding, so long as an actual extended
character encountered in the source file,
and the same extended character
expressed in the source file as a
universal-character-name (i.e., using the
\uXXXX notation), are handled
equivalently except where this
replacement is reverted.)<BR/>
In 2.2 [lex.phases] paragraph 1, phase 3:<BR/>
The source file is decomposed into
preprocessing tokens (2.5) and
sequences of white-space characters
(including comments). A source file shall
not end in a partial preprocessing token
or in a partial comment. Each comment
is replaced by one space character.
New-line characters are retained.
Whether each nonempty sequence of
white-space characters other than newline
is retained or replaced by one space
character is unspecified. The process of
dividing a source file's characters into
preprocessing tokens is contextdependent.
[ Example: see the handling
of &lt; within a #include preprocessing
directive. &#8212;end example ]<BR/>
In 2.2 [lex.phases] paragraph 1, phase 5:<BR/>
Each source character set member in a
character literal or a string literal, as well
as each escape sequence and universal-character-name
in a character literal or a
non-raw string literal, is converted to the
corresponding member of the execution
character set (2.14.3, 2.14.5); if there is
no corresponding member, it is
converted to an implementation-defined
member other than the null (wide)
character.<BR/>
In 2.3 [lex.charset] paragraph 2:<BR/>
.... Additionally, if the hexadecimal value
for a universal-character-name outside
the c-char-sequence or s-char-sequence
of a character or string literal
corresponds to a control character (in
either of the ranges 0x000x1F or 0x7F
0x9F, both inclusive) or to a character in
the basic source character set, the
program is ill-formed. [ Footnote: A
sequence of characters resembling a
universal-character-name in an r-char-sequence
(2.14.5 [lex.string]) does not
form a universal-character-name. ]<BR/>
In 2.5 [lex.pptoken] paragraph 3:<BR/>
If the input stream has been parsed into
preprocessing tokens up to a given
character:
<UL><LI> if the next character begins a
sequence of characters that
could be the prefix and initial
double quote of a raw string
literal, such as R", the next
preprocessing token shall be a
raw string literal and any
transformations performed in
phases 1 and 2 on this input
stream (trigraphs, universal-character-names, and line
splicing) are reverted for the
remainder of the stream until
said raw string literal (2.14.5) is
matched; [ Footnote: A raw
string literal formed through
token concatenation (16.3.3) is
not parsed from an input stream
and is not subject to this
reverting. Destringization (16.9)
involves an alternate input
stream, thus there are no phase
1 or phase 2 transformations to
revert. ]</LI>
<LI> otherwise, the next
preprocessing token is the
longest sequence of characters
that could constitute a
preprocessing token, even if
that would cause further lexical
analysis to fail.</LI></UL>

"Combining characters should not appear as the first

This is not reflected in FCD.<BR/>
2)
Restrictions on the first character of an identifier are not
observed as
recommended in TR 10176:2003. The inclusion of digits
(outside of those in
the basic character set) under identifer-nondigit is implied
by FCD.<BR/>
3)
It is implied that only the "main listing" from Annex A is
included for C++.
That is, the list ends with the Special Characters section.
This is not made
explicit in FCD. Existing practice in C++03 as well as WG
14 (C, as of N1425)
and WG 4 (COBOL, as of N4315) is to include a list in a
normative Annex.<BR/>
4)

Related to core issue 1027, consider:
<PRE>
int f() {
union U { double d; } u1, u2;
(int&amp;)u1.d = 1;
u2 = u1;
return (int&amp;)u2.d;
}
</PRE>
Does this involve undefined behavior? 3.8/4 seems to say
that it's OK to clobber u1 with an int object. Then union
assignment copies the object representation, possibly
creating an int object in u2 and making the return
statement well-defined. If this is well-defined, compilers
are significantly limited in the assumptions they can make
about type aliasing. On the other hand, the variant where
U has an array of unsigned char member must be well-defined
in order to support std::aligned_storage.
</description>
<suggestion>
Clarify that this testcase is undefined, but that
adding an array of unsigned char to union U would
make it well-defined--if a storage location is
allocated with a particular type, it should be
undefined to create an object in that storage if it
would be undefined to access the stored value of
the object through the allocated type.

The CD1 comment CH1 should be reconsidered. The
request for being able to cast a pointer to member to a
pointer to a base class (or any other implicitly convertible
type) of the member is a bugfix rather than an extension.
It's a safe conversion, thus it should be allowed. There are
valid use cases for such conversions that are currently
forbidden.
</description>
<suggestion>
The standard should allow implicit conversions
from &#8220;pointer to member of T of type cv D&#8221; to
'pointer to member of T of type cv B', where D is
of class type and B is a public base of D, It should
allow explicit conversion the other way around.

With respect to the target type, pointer to members should
behave like normal pointers. The current situation creates
an inconsistency in the C++ type system and is therefore
a defect in the Standard.

The standard should allow implicit conversions
from ``pointer to member of T of type cv D'' to
``pointer to member of T of type cv B'', where D is
of class type and B is a public base of D. It should

captured by an immediately enclosing lambda expression
m2..." - that is, it describes a situation with m2 enclosing
m1, and then describes the capture transformation in
these terms.
The example given to support this, however, turns this all
around and shows m1 enclosing m2. This doesn't make
either the text or the example incorrect in any sense, but I
would suggest that it adds a level of confusion that is
easily avoided.

Order of initialization of arguments in a function is
fundamental to the memory model of C++, and the

defining function call operators - which currently says
nothing. The rules covering this are buried in paragraph

most helpful. In particular, it should be made clear that
such initialization is indeterminately sequenced (and not
unsequenced.)

In the definition of "potential constant expression" in
paragraph 6, it is unclear how "arbitrary" the substitution
of the function parameters is. Does it mean "there exists a
value for which the result is a constant expression" or
does it mean "for all possible values, the result needs to
be a constant expression"? Example:
<PRE>
constexpr int f(int x){return x + 1; }
</PRE>
is a constant expression under the first interpretation, but
not under the second (because overflow occurs for x ==
INT_MAX, cf. 5.19p2 bullet 5). The answer also affects
expressions such as:
<PRE>
constexpr int f2(bool v) { return v ? throw 0 : 0; }
constexpr int f3(bool v) { return v &amp;&amp; (throw 0, 0); }

It is not clear how overload resolution applies within a
constexpr function. In particular, if an expression in the
function body yields an integral value of 0 for some
parameter values, and not for others, is it usable as a null
pointer constant when evaluated as a constant
expression.
<PRE>
typedef char (&amp;One)[1];
typedef char (&amp;Two)[2];
One f(void*); // #1
Two f(...); // #2
constexpr int test(int n) { return sizeof f(n); }
constexpr int test2(int n) { return sizeof f(n*0); }
int q = 0;
#include
int main() {
char a[test(0)];
std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(a) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // #3
std::cout &lt;&lt; test(q) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // #4
char b[test2(0)];
std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(b) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // #5
std::cout &lt;&lt; test2(q) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // #6
}
</PRE>
#3 and #4 should print 2, since n is not an integral
constant expression with value 0 in the body of test() ---
though it is a constant expression when test() is evaluated
as a constant expression, it's value is dependent on the
invocation. Permitting different results of overload
resolution within the same function body in different calling
contexts would violate ODR.<BR/>
On the other hand, in test2(), the answer is no longer
dependent on the value of n, since "n*0" always evaluates
to 0. However, it is not clear from the FCD whether "n*0"
is thus a constant expression (and therefore a valid null
pointer constant) inside the body of test2. Either way both
#5 and #6 should print the same value; it would violate
ODR for #5 to print "1" (indicating that "n*0" was a valid
null pointer constant when test2() is evaluated in a
constant expression context) whilst #6 prints "2" (since
n*0 is not a constant expression if n is not constant). #5
and #6 should thus both print "1", or both print "2".

"for (auto e : range)" creates copies of elements. This
seems like a gotcha for new users. Not only are copies
inefficient for reading, but writing to copies won't modify
the original elements.<BR/>
Permitting "for ( identifier : expression )" and giving it the
same meaning as "for ( auto&amp; identifier : expression )"
would make the range-based for statement easier to teach
and to use, and should be trivial to specify and to
implement.

6.5.4/1 requires that range-based for loops behave as if
they had "{ auto&amp;&amp; __range = (expression); for (auto
__begin = begin_expr, __end = end_expr; ..." which
implies that __begin and __end must have the same type.
However, this prevents stateful iterators with an end
sentinel of a different type. Since range-based for loops'
equivalent code already introduces a block (for the
__range variable), could __begin and __end be placed
there, as "auto __begin = begin_expr; auto __end =
end_expr;"?<BR/>
Example of what this change would allow, only the
relevant details shown with ctors, op*, op++, etc. omitted:
(apologies if the formatting is lost)<BR/>
struct End {}; struct Counter { Counter&amp; begin() { return
*this; } // used by begin_expr End end() { return End(); } //
used by end_expr bool operator!=(End) const { return
_current != _end; }<BR/>
Counter(int begin, int end) : _current(begin), _end(end) {}
int _current, _end; };<BR/>

takes values from 0..9 } }

A constexpr function is not permitted to return via an
exception. This should be recognised, and a function
declared 'constexpr' without an explicit exception
specification should be treated as if declared
'noexcept(true)' rather than the usual 'noexcept(false)'. For
a function template declared constexpr without an explicit
exception specification, it should be considered
'noexcept(true)' if and only if the constexpr keyword is
respected on a given instantiation.

The premise is not correct: an exception is forbidden only when a

Instead of changing the default exception specification, the result
of the <TT>noexcept</TT> operator was changed, based on whether the
invocation of the function is a constant expression or not.

Making the use of [[ illegal except where introducing an
attribute specifier is just reintroducing the problem we had
with &gt;&gt; for closing nested templates, albeit in a minor and
less common form.
As Jason Merrill commented in c++std-core-16046, there
is no ambiguity in practice because code couldn't actually
be well-formed under interpretation as both an attribute
specifier and a lambda introducer. A small amount of
lookahead would be required to differentiate the cases,
but this should not be a problem.
This restriction also means that lambdas in macros must
be enclosed in parentheses to avoid accidental
interpretation as an illegal attribute specifier if used as an
array index.

C has rejected the notion of attributes, and introduced the
noreturn facility as a keyword. To continue writing clean,
portable code we should replace the [[noreturn]] attribute
with a 'noreturn' keyword, following the usual convention
that while C obfuscates new keywords with _Capital and
adds a macro to map to the comfortable spelling, C++
simply adopts the all-lowercase spelling.

<description>
Even if attributes continue to be standardized over
continued objections from both of the two vendors who
are cited as the principal prior art, we can live with them
with the exception of the virtual override controls. This
result is just awful, as already shown in the example in
7.6.5 (excerpted):
<PRE>
class D [[base_check]] : public B {
void sone_func [[override]] ();
virtual void h [[ hiding]] (char*);
};
</PRE>
Here we have six keywords (not counting void and char)
three normal keywords, and three [[decorated]]
keywords. There has already been public ridicule of
C++0x about this ugliness. This is just a poor language
design, even in the face of backward compatibility
concerns (e.g., that some existing code may already use
those words as identifiers) because those concerns have
already been resolved in other ways in existing practice
(see below)<BR/>
More importantly, this is exactly the abuse of attributes as
disguised keywords that was objected to and was
explicitly promised not to happen in order to get this
proposal passed. The use of attributes for the virtual
control keywords is the most egregious abuse of the
attribute syntax, and at least that use of attributes must be
fixed by replacing them with non-attribute syntax.
These virtual override controls are language features, not
annotations.<BR/>
It is possible to have nice names and no conflicts with
existing code by using contextual keywords, such as
recognizing the word as having the special meaning when
it appears in a grammar position where no user identifier
can appear, as demonstrated in C++/CLI which has five
years of actual field experience with a large number of
customers (and exactly no name conflict or programmer
confusion problems reported in the field during the five
years this has been available):
<PRE>
class D : public B {
void sone_func() override; // same meaning as
[[override]] - explicit override
virtual void h (char*) new; // same meaning as
[[hiding]] - a new function, not an override
};
int override = 42; // ok, override is not a
reserved keyword
</PRE>
The above forms are implementable, have been
implemented, have years of practical field experience, and
work. Developers love them. Whether the answer is to
follow this existing practice or something else, there needs
to be a more natural replacement for the currently
[[attributed]] keywords for virtual override control which is
an ugly novelty that has no field experience and that
developers have already ridiculed.

The rule "...or the reference shall be an rvalue reference
and the initializer expression shall be an rvalue or have a
function type" is stated in terms of the rvalue-ness of the
expression rather than the eventual target of the
reference; this leads to some undesirable results, such as
<PRE>
struct A { };
struct B {
operator A&amp;();
};
A&amp;&amp; aref = B(); // binds to lvalue
</PRE>

<description>
It seems that lvalues of any sort don't bind to non-const
rvalue ref args, even if an intermediate temporary would
be created.
See the discussion at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2748866/c0x-rvalue-references-and-temporaries.<BR/>
I'll summarise that here: Assume that std::vector has
push_back overloads declared as follows, with SFINAE
omitted for clarity:
<PRE>
void push_back(const T &amp;);
//Copies the const T &amp; into the vector's storage
void push_back(T &amp;&amp;);
//Moves the T &amp;&amp; into the vector's storage
</PRE>
Then this code appears to behave as commented, as of
N3090:
<PRE>
const char * cchar = "Hello, world"; std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;
v;
v.push_back(cchar);
//makes a temporary string, copies the string
into vector storage using push_back(const T&amp;)
v.push_back(std::string(cchar));
//makes a temporary string, moves the string into vector
storage using push_back(T&amp;&amp;)
v.push_back(std::move(cchar));
//makes a temporary string, moves the string into the
vector using push_back(T&amp;&amp;)
</PRE>
Johannes Schaub (litb) convincingly argued that the
reason for this is clause 8.5.3/5 describing reference
binding - it allows direct binding of lvalues, bindings that
require conversion sequences to const lvalue refs, and
rvalues to rvalue refs. But it doesn't allow for lvalues to
ever bind to rvalue refs, even if an intermediate temporary
would otherwise need to be created.<BR/>
This isn't what I (as a user of std::vector) expect to
happen. I expect all of these push_back calls to do the
same thing, namely, select the push_back(T&amp;&amp;) overload,
create a temporary string object from 'cchar', bind the
temporary string to the argument, and hence move (not
copy) the temporary string into vector's storage.<BR/>
It seems particularly strange that v.push_back(cchar)
"requires" an extra copy, but
v.push_back(std::move(cchar)) does not. It almost
seems like indicating that 'cchar' is potentially-movable (by
casting it to an rvalue ref using std::move) allows moving
from a completely different object - the temporary string.<BR/>
I suggest extending the rules for initializing const lvalue
refs via implicit conversions (8.5.3/5), to also apply to
rvalue refs.<BR/>
This also raises an additional question of whether lvalues
of _copyable_ types should be copied into a temporary
object so that they may bind to an rvalue ref. Allowing this
would not affect const T&amp;/T&amp;&amp; overload pairs. But
it could be potentially useful when writing functions that
wish to accept a number of rvalue refs to copyable-but-not-movable
types (such as all C++03 classes with user-defined
copy constructors), or when writing functions that
"take apart" a number their arguments in a way that is
different from a straightforward move (perhaps some
tree operations would want to do this).<BR/>
Conversely, it might seem odd that declarations such as:
<PRE>
string &amp;&amp; s = string_lvalue;
string &amp;&amp; s = string_rvalue_ref_variable;
//mistake, std::move(string_rvalue_ref_variable) was
intended
</PRE>
...would both
silently copy their arguments and bind to the copy, instead
of being invalid as they are now.<BR/>
We believe this is core issue 953
</description>
<suggestion>
Possible wording: amend the second list
item in 8.5.3/5:<BR/>
Otherwise, the reference shall be an lvalue
reference to a non-volatile const type (i.e., cv1
shall be const), or the reference shall be an rvalue
reference [deleted the rest of the sentence]. [The
last example would also need to be deleted.]

There are definitions for these types in the text, yet it is left
unclear what use these classifications have. The types are
very close to each other, which makes them confusing. If
the reader must rely on external references, then these
references should be specified (which is undesirable, or
even disallowed by ISO(?)). As it stands, there is an
example for using standard-layout classes (with other
programming languages). There are also uses specified
for literal types. One can imagine many uses for these
four/five types, so it is important to have a clear
specification of the intent as to where each of these types
is expected to be used.

The signedness of bit-fields is the only time when 'signed
int' is any different to just 'int'.<BR/>
In C it is possible to remember whether a typedef uses
'signed' but in C++ it doesn't make sense and will result in
ODR violations if A&lt;long&gt; and A&lt;signed long&gt; are not
exactly equivalent.<BR/>
This also causes portability problems because it is not
specified whether typedefs such as int32_t are defined
with 'signed' so using the &lt;cstdint&gt; types in bitfields is
problematic.<BR/>
It is common to want to guarantee a bit-field has a
minimum number of bits, for which the &lt;cstdint&gt; types are
useful, except that the signedness of a bit-field using
int32_t might depend on both unspecified and
implementation-defined behaviour.
</description>
<suggestion>
'signed int' should always be equivalent to 'int' in
all contexts.<BR/>
A possible alternative would be to specify that
signed types in &lt;cstdint&gt; are declared with
'signed' so that using them for bit-fields has
predictable results, but this doesn't address the
ODR issue with A&lt;long&gt; and A&lt;signed long&gt;

In the core mailing list, Daniel Krugler points out
that the current wording is ambiguous as to
whether this is legal (although an editorial
example suggests otherwise), and observes that it
should be OK as long as D2 is complete at the
point of definition of D1::f. The standard should
resolve the ambiguity by saying that D2 only
needs to be complete at the point of definition of
D1::f.<BR/>
The core mailing list message text is below:<BR/>
I would be happy, if the standard would just allow
this, but IMO the
current wording seems to be readable in different
ways (e.g.
Comeau rejects the code). I think the reason is
that [class.virtual]/5
just says:<BR/>
"The return type of an overriding function shall be
either identical to
the return type of the overridden function or
covariant with the
classes of the functions.[..]"<BR/>
This restriction is IMO only necessary for the
*definition* of D::f.
Secondly p. 6 says:<BR/>
"If the return type of D::f differs from the return
type of B::f, the class
type in the return type of D::f shall be complete at
the point of
declaration of D::f or shall be the class type D.[..]"<BR/>
and shows the following example that explicitly
forbids that (simplified):
<PRE>
struct Base {
virtual B* vf5();
};
class A;
struct Derived : public Base {
A* vf5(); // error: returns pointer to incomplete
class
};
</PRE>

It is necessary to be able to calculate the offsets applied to

What effect does defaulting have on triviality? Related to
FI 1, non-public special members defaulted on their first
declaration should retain triviality, because they shouldn't
be considered user-provided. Related to FI 3, defaulted
member functions that are virtual should not be
considered trivial, but there's no reason why non-virtuals
could not be.<BR/>
Furthermore, a class with a non-public explicitly-defaulted
constructor isn't ever trivially constructible under the
current rules. If such a class is used as a subobject, the
constructor of the aggregating class should be trivial if it
can access the non-public explicitly defaulted constructor
of a subobject.
</description>
<suggestion>
Change the triviality rules so that a class can have
a trivial default constructor if the class has access
to the default constructors of its subobjects and
the default constructors of the subobjects are
explicitly defaulted on first declaration, even if said
defaulted constructors are non-public.<BR/>

It is very difficult to write correct programs that do not call
'terminate' in the presence of destructors that can throw
exceptions, and this practice has long been discouraged.
Many implicitly declared destructors already carry
noexcept declarations (mostly types with trivial
destructors) and it is anticipated it will become common
practice to want a user-declared destructor to be declared
noexcept. This becomes important evaluating the
noexcept operator, where any of the unevaluated subexpressions
may produce a temporary object. As this is
expected to be the overwhelmingly common case, a user-declared
destructor that does not supply an exception
specification should be considered as if declared
noexcept(true) rather than noexcept(false), the default for
every other function.

Same as FI 4, the parts involving copy constructors and
copy assignment operators.<BR/>
A class with a non-public explicitly-defaulted copy
constructor isn't ever trivially copyable under the current
rules. If such a class is used as a subobject, the copy
constructor of the aggregating class should be trivial if it
can access the non-public explicitly defaulted copy
constructor of a subobject.
</description>
<suggestion>
Change the triviality rules so that a class can
have a trivial copy constructor if the class has
access to the copy constructors of its subobjects
and the copy constructors of the subobjects are
explicitly defaulted on first declaration, even if said
defaulted copy constructors are non-public.

The current wording reads, "A copy/move assignment
operator that is defaulted and not defined as deleted is
implicitly defined when an object of its class type is
assigned a value of its class type or a value of a class
type derived from its class type or when it is explicitly
defaulted after its first declaration." This sounds as if any
assignment to a class object, regardless of whether it is a
copy or a move assignment, defines both the copy and
move operators. Presumably an assignment should only
define the assignment operator chosen by overload
resolution for the operation. (Compare the corresponding
wording in p14 for the copy/move constructors:
"...implicitly defined if it is used to initialize an object of its
class type..." (Core issue 1066 in N3083.)
</description>
<suggestion>
Clarify the wording so that only the operator
needed for the operation is implicitly defined.

<description>
Overload resolution within the operand of a unary &amp;
operator is done by selecting the function "whose type
matches the target type required in the context." The
criterion for determining whether the types match,
however, is not defined. At least three possibilities
suggest themselves:<BR/>
1. The types are identical.<BR/>
2. The source type can be implicitly converted to
the target type.<BR/>
3. The expression would be well-formed if the
function under consideration were not
overloaded.<BR/>
This question arises for pointer-to-member types, where
there is an implicit conversion from a pointer-to-base-member
to a pointer-to-derived-member, as well as when
the context is an explicit type conversion (which allows for
static_cast a conversion from pointer-to-derived-member
to a pointer-to-base-member and, in the reinterpret_cast
interpretation of functional and old-style casts, essentially
any conversion).

r country In FCD sub-clause 14.5.6.2 [temp.func.order]
paragraph 3, we are told to synthesize, "for each type,
non-type, or template template parameter... a unique type,
value, or class template respectively."
These are then substituted for each occurrence of the
respective parameter in the function type of the function
template.
It is not specified what the properties of said synthetics
are, for example, members of a dependent type referred
to in non-deduced contexts are not specified to exist,
although the transformed function type would be invalid if
they do not exist.
We may assume, for example, that each synthetic will be
given minimal properties such that the transformed
function type is valid at the point of definition of the
template.<BR/>
Example 1:<BR/>
template &lt;typename T, typename U&gt; struct A; template
&lt;typename T&gt; void foo(A&lt;T, typename T::u&gt; *) { } // #1 //
synthetic T1 has member T1::u template &lt;typename T&gt;
void foo(A&lt;T, typename T::u::v&gt; *) { } // #2 // synthetic T2
has member T2::u and member T2::u::v // T in #1 deduces
to synthetic T2 in partial ordering; // deduced A for the
parameter is A&lt;T2, T2::u&gt; *--this is not necessarily
compatible // with A&lt;T2, T2::u::v&gt; * and it does not need
to be. See Note 1. The effect is that // (in the call below)
the compatibility of B::u and B::u::v is respected. // T in #2
cannot be successfully deduced in partial ordering from
A&lt;T1, T1::u&gt; *; // invalid type T1::u::v will be formed when
T1 is substituted into non-deduced contexts. struct B {
struct u { typedef u v; }; }; int main() { foo((A&lt;B, B::u&gt; *)0);
// calls #2 } *Note 1: Template argument deduction is an
attempt to match a P and to a deduced A; however,
template argument deduction is not specified to fail if the
P and the deduced A are incompatible. This may occur in
the presence of non-deduced contexts. Notwithstanding
the parenthetical statement in [temp.deduct.partial]
paragraph 9, template argument deduction may succeed
in determining a template argument for every template
parameter while producing a deduced A that is not
compatible with the corresponding P.<BR/>
Example 2:<BR/>
template &lt;typename T, typename U, typename V&gt; struct
A; template &lt;typename T&gt; void foo(A&lt;T, struct T::u, struct
T::u::u&gt; *); #2.1 // synthetic T1 has member non-union
class T1::u template &lt;typename T, typename U&gt; void
foo(A&lt;T, U , U&gt; *); #2.2 // synthetic T2 and U2 has no
required properties // T in #2.1 cannot be deduced in
partial ordering from A&lt;T2, U2, U2&gt; *;// invalid types T2::u
and T2::u::u will be formed when T2 is substituted in nondeduced
contexts. // T and U in #2.2 deduces to,
respectively, T1 and T1::u from A&lt;T1, T1::u, struct
T1::u::u&gt; * unless // struct T1::u::u does not refer to the
injected-class-name of the class T1::u (if that is possible).
struct B { struct u { }; }; int main() { foo((A&lt;B, B::u, struct
B::u::u&gt; *)0); // calls #2.1 } It is however unclear to what
extent an implementation will have to go to determine
these minimal properties.

The current wording of 7.1.3p2 requires that the identifier
in an alias-declaration "...shall not appear in the type-id."
With template aliases, however, the name of the alias can
be used indirectly:
<PRE>
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A;
template&lt;typename T&gt; using B=typename A&lt;T&gt;::U;
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A {
typedef B&lt;T&gt; U;
};
B&lt;short&gt; b;
</PRE>
Here the instantiation of B&lt;short&gt; causes the instantiation
of A&lt;short&gt;, and the typedef in A&lt;short&gt; ends up
attempting to use B&lt;short&gt;, which is still in the process of
being instantiated.

14.6.2.1p3

<description>
If I'm not missing something, 14.6.2.1/3 says that in the
definition of a class template or member of a class
template, the injected-class-name refers to the current
instantiation. The template name followed by the
argument list enclosed in &#8220;&lt;..&gt;&#8221; also refers to the current
instantiation, but only in the definition of a primary class
template. That results in an odd situation:<BR/>
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A { typedef int type; void
f(type); }; // here we are outside the definition of 'A'<BR/>
template&lt;typename T&gt; void A::f(A::type) { } // OK: 'A' is
the injected-class-name<BR/>
template&lt;typename T&gt; void A::f(A&lt;T&gt;::type) { } // ill-formed:
'A&lt;T&gt;' is not the injected-class-name. Needs
'typename '!<BR/>
If you would define the member-function within the
primary class template, bullet 2 would apply:<BR/>
template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A {<BR/>
typedef int type; void f(A&lt;T&gt;::type) { } // OK: name of A
followed by arguments enclosed in &lt;..&gt;<BR/>
};<BR/>
I think that this state of affairs isn't any good.<BR/>
-&gt; Suggested solution: Change 14.6.2.1/1 bullet2 to apply
also to members of the primary class template. The same
for bullet4 talking about partial specializations. Since
partial specializations are also class templates, i wonder
whether one could also smelt together bullet2 and bullet4
and only talk about &#8220;class template&#8221;.

Updated 14.6.2.1 [temp.dep.type] p1 bullet 2:
" in the definition of a primary class template or
a member of a class template, the name of the
class template followed by the template argument
list of the primary template (as described below)
enclosed in &lt;&gt;,"

Given the change in N1376=02-0034 to [temp.res], found
in FCD in [temp.res] paragraph 5:<BR/>
A qualified name used as the name in a mem-initializer-id,
a base-specifier, or an elaborated-type-specifier is
implicitly assumed to name a
type, without the use of the typename keyword<BR/>
the following appears to be well-formed, with templates
foo() being distinct since any type T will produce an invalid
type for the second parameter for at least one foo() when
T is replaced within the non-deduced context:
<PRE>
template &lt;typename T&gt;
bool *foo(T *, enum T::u_type * = 0) { return 0; }
template &lt;typename T&gt; char *foo(T *, struct T::u_type * =
0) { return 0; }
struct A { enum u_type { I }; }; int main(void) { foo((A*)0); }
</PRE>
In particular, while determining the signature (1.3.11
[defns.signature]) for the function templates foo(), an
elaborated-type-specifier qualifies as part of the decl-specifier-seq
under 8.3.5 [dcl.fct] paragraph 5 in
determining the type of a parameter in the parameter-type-list
(absent additional wording).
Also, the return type is included in the signature of a
function template.<BR/>
A portion of the GCC 4.5.0 output:<BR/>
Internal compiler error: Error reporting routines re-entered.
Please submit a full bug report, with preprocessed source
if appropriate. See &lt; http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs.html &gt; for
instructions.<BR/>
Implementations do not appear to support this case and
the ability to do so brings little value since type traits such
as is_enum and is_class cannot be defined using this and
equivalent functionality can be achieved using the
aforementioned type traits.
<PRE>
template &lt;typename T&gt; struct MY_is_enum :
std::false_type { };
template &lt;typename T&gt; struct MY_is_enum&lt;enum T&gt; :
std::true_type { }; // ill-formed,

elaborated-type-specifier resolves to typedef-name

Core Issue 1014 claims that calling f(const T&amp;) and f(T&amp;&amp;)
with a const int lvalue is ambiguous. It's unambiguous
because the partial ordering rules consider f(const T&amp;) to
be more specialized than f(T&amp;&amp;), for the same reasons
that they consider h(const T&amp;) to be more specialized than
h(T&amp;).<BR/>
However, calling z(T&amp;) and z(T&amp;&amp;) with an int lvalue is
ambiguous. Because z(T&amp;) accepts a strict subset of the
things that z(T&amp;&amp;) accepts, it seems that the partial
ordering rules should be modified to consider z(T&amp;) to be
more specialized than z(T&amp;&amp;). There may be additional
subtleties.

This paragraph says that "An object that is... partially
destroyed will have destructors executed... for subobjects
for which the principal constructor (12.6.2) has completed
execution and the destructor has not yet begun
execution." This would presumably apply to an example
like
<PRE>
struct S { ~S(); } s[10];
</PRE>
If the destructor for s[5] throws an exception, elements 0-4
should still be destroyed. However, the wording
specifically refers to "fully constructed base classes and
non-variant members," even though array elements are
subobjects of the array (1.8p2). This is presumably the
effect of stack unwinding (p1), which applies to "all
automatic objects constructed since the try block was
entered," but whether that should also be expected for
arrays of static, thread, and dynamic storage duration is
not clear.

All library types should have non-throwing move
constructors and move-assignment operators unless
wrapping a type with a potentially throwing moveoperation.
When such a type is a class-template, these
operations should have a conditional noexcept
specification.<BR/>
There are many other places where a noexcept
specification may be considered, but the move operations
are a special case that must be called out, to effectively
support the move_if_noexcept function template.
</description>
<suggestion>
Review every class and class template in the
library. If noexcept move constructor/assignment
operators can be implicitly declared, then they

specification should be provided.

Issues with efficiency and unsatisfactory semantics mean
many library functions document they do not throw
exceptions with a Throws: Nothing clause, but do not
advertise it with an exception specification. The semantic
issues are largely resolved with the new 'noexcept'
specifications, and the noexcept operator means we will
want to detect these guarantees programatically in order
to construct programs taking advantage of the guarantee.
</description>
<suggestion>
Add a 'noexcept' exception specification on each
libary API that offers an unconditional Throws:
Nothing guarantee. Where the guarantee is
conditional, add the appropriate
noexcept(constant-expression) if an appropriate
constant expression exists.

<description>
Since the newly introduced operator noexcept makes it
easy (easier than previously) to detect whether or not a
function has been declared with the empty exception
specification (including noexcept) library functions that
cannot throw should be decorated with the empty
exception specification. Failing to do so and leaving it as a
matter of QoI would be detrimental to portability and
efficiency.
</description>
<suggestion>
Review the whole library, and apply the noexcept
specification where it is appropriate.

<description>
There are a number of unspecified types used throughout
the library, such as the container iterators. Many of these
unspecified types have restrictions or expectations on
their behaviour in terms of exceptions. Are they permitted
or required to use exception specifications, more
specifically the new noexcept specification? For example,
if vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator is implemented as a native pointer,
all its operations will have an (effective) nothrow
specification. If the implementation uses a class type to
implement this iterator, is it permitted or required to
support that same guarantee?
</description>
<suggestion>
Clearly state the requirements for exception
specifications on all unspecified library types. For
example, all container iterator operations should
be conditionally noexcept, with the condition
matching the same operation applied to the
allocator pointer_type, a certain subset of which
are already required not to throw.

Nothrowing swap operations are key to many C++ idioms,
notably the common copy/swap idiom to provide the
strong exception safety guarantee.
</description>
<suggestion>
Where possible, all library types should provide a
swap operation with an exception specification
guaranteeing no exception shall propagate.
Where noexcept(true) cannot be guaranteed to
not terminate the program, and the swap in
questions is a template, an exception specification
with the appropriate conditional expression could
be specified.

The syntax for attributes was altered specifically to make it
legal do declare attributes on functions by making the
attribute the first token in the declaration, rather than
inserting it between the function name and the opening
paren of the parameter list. This is much more readable,
and should be the preferred style throughout the library.
For example, prefer:<BR/>
[[noreturn]] void exit(int status);<BR/>
to<BR/>
void exit [[noreturn]] (int status);
</description>
<suggestion>
Update all function declarations throughout the
library to use the preferred placement of functionlevel
attributes.

similarly primitive set of functionality, with no dependency
of a hosted environment, but does go beyond the minimal

Alternatively, split the move/forward/swap/declval
functions out of &lt;utility&gt; and into a new primitive header,

defines it. For example, is the following code required to

One idea for the exception_ptr type was that a referencecounted
implementation could simply 'reactivate' the same
exception object in the context of a call to
'rethrow_exception'. Such an implementation would allow
the same exception object to be active in multiple threads
(such as when multiple threads join on a shared_future)
and introduce potential data races in any exception
handler that catches exceptions by reference - notably
existing library code written before this capability was
added. 'rethrow_exception' should *always* make a copy
of the target exception object.

<description>
None of the exception types defined in clause 19 are
allowed to throw an exception on copy or move
operations, but there is no clear specification that the
operations have an exception specification to prove it.
Note that the implicitly declared constructors, taking the
exception specification from their base class (ultimately
std::exception) will implicitly generate a noexcept
exception specification if all of their data members
similarly declare noexcept operations. As the
representation is unspecified, we cannot assume nonthrowing
operations unless we explicitly state this as a
constraint on the implementation.
</description>
<suggestion>
Add a global guarantee that all exception types
defined in clause 19 that rely on implicitly declared
operations have a non-throwing exception
specification on those operations.

The C++0x FCD recommends, in a note (see 19.5.1.1/1),
that users
create a single error category object for each user defined
error
category and specifies error_category equality
comparsions based on
equality of addresses (19.5.1.3). The Draft apparently
ignores this
when specifying standard error category objects in section
19.5.1.5,
by allowing the generic_category() and system_category()
functions to
return distinct objects for each invocation.
</description>
<suggestion>
Append a new sentence to 19.5.1.5
[syserr.errcat.objects]/1, which
reads "All calls of this function return references to
the same
object.", and append the same sentence to
19.5.1.5/3.

The FCD contains a requirement that all standard classes

The library provides several traits mechanisms intended a
customization points for users. Typically, they are
declared in headers that are growing quite large. This is
not a problem for standard library vendors, who can
manage their internal file structure to avoid large
dependencies, but can be a problem for end users who
have no option but to include these large headers.

<suggestion>
Move the following traits classes into their own
headers, and require the existing header to
#include the traits header to support backwards

Table 34
</para>
<description>
20.2.1 Table 34 "MoveConstructible requirements" says
"Note: rv remains a valid object. Its state is unspecified".
Some components give stronger guarantees. For
example, moved-from shared_ptrs are guaranteed empty
(20.9.11.2.1/25).
In general, what the standard really should say (preferably
as a global blanket statement) is that moved-from objects
can be destroyed and can be the destination of an
assignment. Anything else is radioactive. For example,
containers can be "emptier than empty". This needs to be
explicit and required generally.<BR/>
Note: The last time that one of us mentioned "emptier
than empty" (i.e. containers missing sentinel nodes, etc.)
the objection was that containers can store sentinel nodes
inside themselves in order to avoid dynamically allocating
them. This is unacceptable because (a) it forces existing
implementations (i.e. Dinkumware's, Microsoft's, IBM's,
etc.) to change for no good reason (i.e. permitting more
operations on moved-from objects), and (b) it invalidates
end iterators when swapping containers. (The Working
Paper currently permits end iterator invalidation, which we
consider to be wrong, but that's a separate argument. In
any event, *mandating* end iterator invalidation is very
different from permitting it.)
</description>
<suggestion>
State as a general requirement that moved-from
objects can be destroyed and can be the
destination of an assignment. Any other use is
undefined behavior.

Reads of indeterminate value result in undefined
behaviour<BR/>
In 20.2.3p2, NullablePointer requirements
[nullablepointer.requirements], the standard specifies the
behaviour of programs that read indeterminate values:<BR/>
... A default-initialized object of type P may have
an indeterminate value. [ Note: Operations involving
indeterminate values may cause undefined behaviour.
end note ]<BR/>
We suggest changing the note to:<BR/>
[ Note: Operations involving indeterminate values
cause undefined behaviour. end note ]<BR/>
Rationale: The note uses the word "may", but we believe
the intention is that such reads will cause undefined
behaviour, but implementations are not required to
produce an error.<BR/>
Clark adds:<BR/>
&gt; Unfortunately, this issue goes deeper than can be<BR/>
&gt; addressed by deleting the word "may" from a note in<BR/>
&gt; clause 20. The term "indeterminate value" and its<BR/>
&gt; meaning were introduced in C99. While the term is<BR/>
&gt; generally understood to be applicable to C++ (and<BR/>
&gt; section 20.2.3 reflects that), the term isn't actually<BR/>
&gt; defined in the C++ WD, and worse yet, there's no<BR/>
&gt; statement that use of an indeterminate value can result<BR/>
&gt; in undefined behavior (so the existing note can't be<BR/>
&gt; deduced from the normative statements of the<BR/>
standard).
&gt; This is tracked by core issue 616. The wording in<BR/>
&gt; 20.2.3 should be noted as relating to that issue, and<BR/>
&gt; should be handled as part thereof.<BR/>
Further on this, in the current draft standard, we can
construct executions in which an atomic read happensbefore
the initialization of the atomic object, so there is no
place to take a read value from. We imagine that such
reads should also be of indeterminate values and result in
undefined behaviour?
</description>

In 20.2.3p2, the standard specifies the behaviour
of programs that read indeterminate values:<BR/>
... A default-initialized object of

In n3090, at variance with previous iterations of the idea
discussed in papers and incorporated in WDs,
std::forward is constrained via std::is_convertible, thus is
not robust wrt access control. This causes problems in
normal uses as implementation detail of member
functions. For example, the following snippet leads to a
compile time failure, whereas that was not the case for an
implementation along the lines of n2835 (using enable_ifs
instead of concepts for the constraining, of course)
<PRE>
#include &lt;utility&gt;
struct Base { Base(Base&amp;&amp;); };
struct Derived
: private Base
{
Derived(Derived&amp;&amp; d)
: Base(std::forward&lt;Base&gt;(d)) { }

In other terms, LWG 1054 can be resolved in a better

20.3.5.2 and 20.4.2

<description>
pair's class definition in N3092 20.3.5.2 [pairs.pair]
contains "pair(const pair&amp;) = default;" and "pair&amp;
operator=(pair&amp;&amp; p);". The latter is described by
20.3.5.2/12-13.<BR/>
"pair(const pair&amp;) = default;" is a user-declared explicitlydefaulted
copy constructor. According to 12.8
[class.copy]/10, this inhibits the implicitly-declared move
constructor. pair should be move constructible. (12.8/7
explains that "pair(pair&lt;U, V&gt;&amp;&amp; p)" will never be
instantiated to move pair&lt;T1, T2&gt; to pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;.)<BR/>
"pair&amp; operator=(pair&amp;&amp; p);" is a user-provided move
assignment operator (according to 8.4.2
[dcl.fct.def.default]/4: "A special member function is userprovided
if it is user-declared and not explicitly defaulted
on its first declaration."). According to 12.8/20, this inhibits
the implicitly-declared copy assignment operator. pair
should be copy assignable, and was in C++98/03. (Again,
12.8/7 explains that "operator=(const pair&lt;U, V&gt;&amp; p)" will
never be instantiated to copy pair&lt;T1, T2&gt; to pair&lt;T1,
T2&gt;.)<BR/>
Additionally, "pair&amp; operator=(pair&amp;&amp; p);" is
unconditionally defined, whereas according to 12.8/25,
defaulted copy/move assignment operators are defined as
deleted in several situations, such as when non-static data
members of reference type are present.<BR/>
If "pair(const pair&amp;) = default;" and "pair&amp;
operator=(pair&amp;&amp; p);" were removed from pair's class
definition in 20.3.5.2 and from 20.3.5.2/12-13, pair would
receive implicitly-declared copy/move constructors and
copy/move assignment operators, and 12.8/25 would
apply. The implicitly-declared copy/move constructors
would be trivial when T1 and T2 have trivial copy/move
constructors, according to 12.8/13, and similarly for the
assignment operators, according to 12.8/27. Notes could
be added as a reminder that these functions would be
implicitly-declared, but such notes would not be necessary
(the Standard Library specification already assumes a
high level of familiarity with the Core Language, and
casual readers will simply assume that pair is copyable
and movable).<BR/>
Alternatively, pair could be given explicitly-defaulted
copy/move constructors and copy/move assignment
operators. This is a matter of style.<BR/>
tuple is also affected. tuple's class definition in 20.4.2
[tuple.tuple] contains:
<PRE>
tuple(const tuple&amp;) = default;
tuple(tuple&amp;&amp;);
tuple&amp; operator=(const tuple&amp;);
tuple&amp; operator=(tuple&amp;&amp;);
</PRE>
They should all be removed or all be explicitly-defaulted,
to be consistent with pair. Additionally, 20.4.2.1
[tuple.cnstr]/8-9 specifies the behavior of an explicitlydefaulted
function, which is currently inconsistent with
pair.
</description>
<suggestion>
Either remove "pair(const pair&amp;) = default;" and
"pair&amp; operator=(pair&amp;&amp; p);" from pair's class
definition in 20.3.5.2 and from 20.3.5.2/12-13, or
give pair explicitly-defaulted copy/move
constructors and copy/move assignment
operators.<BR/>
Change tuple to match.

<description>
The alias representations of the ratio arithmetic templates
do not allow implementations to avoid overflow, since they
explicitly specify the form of the aliased template
instantiation. For example
ratio_multiply,ratio&lt;2,LLONG_MAX&gt;&gt; is *required* to
alias ratio&lt;2*LLONG_MAX,LLONG_MAX*2&gt;, which
overflows, so is ill-formed. However, this is trivially equal
to ratio&lt;1,1&gt;. It also contradicts the opening statement of
20.6.2p1 "implementations may use other algorithms to
compute these values".
</description>

Several type traits require compiler support, e.g.
std::is_constructible or std::is_convertible. Their current
specification seems to imply, that the corresponding test
expressions should be well-formed, even in absense of
access:
<PRE>
class X { X(int){} };
constexpr bool test = std::is_constructible&lt;X, int&gt;::value;
</PRE>
The specification does not clarify the context of this test
and because it already goes beyond normal language
rules, it's hard to argue by means of normal language
rules what the context and outcome of the test should be.

The adaptable function protocol supported by
unary_function/binary_function has been superceded by
lambda expressions and std::bind. Despite the name, the
protocol is not very adaptable as it requires intrusive
support in the adaptable types, rather than offering an
external traits-like adaption mechanism. This protocol and
related support functions should be deprecated, and we
should not make onerous requirements for the
specification to support this protocol for callable types
introduced in this standard revision, including those
adopted from TR1. It is expected that high-quality
implementations will provide such support, but we should
not have to write robust standard specifications mixing this
restricted support with more general components such as
function, bind and reference_wrapper.

The function templates 'hash', 'less' and 'equal_to' are
important customization points for user-defined types to
be supported by several standard containers. These are
accessed through the &lt;functional&gt; header which has
grown significantly larger in C++0x, exposing many more
facilities than a user is likely to need through there own
header, simply to declare the necessary specialization.
There should be a smaller header available for users to
make the necessary customization.
</description>
<suggestion>
Provide a tiny forwarding header for important
functor types in the &lt;functional&gt; header that a
user may want to specialize. This should contain
the template declaration for 'equal_to', 'hash' and
'less'.

The bind template is intended as a singe, simple to use
replacement for the '98 adaptable function APIs and
machinery. It works well in almost all respects, but lacks
the ability to easily negate a predicate, or equivalently, act
as a replacement for not1 and not2. Two easy ways to
solve this omission would be to add a 'bind_not' function
that produces a binder that negates its result. However,
preference is given to requiring the unspecified bind result
type to overload operator! to produce the same effect.
This is preferred due to (i) its simpler usage, being the
naively expected syntax, but more importantly (ii) some
(limited) field experience.
</description>
<suggestion>
Require the unspecified result of a bind
expression to support unary operator! to yield
another bind result that, when evaluated, yields
'!res', where 'res' is the result of evaluating the
original function.

unique_ptr and shared_ptr are inconsistent in their
handling of arrays. We can write:
<PRE>
unique_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; p( new int[10] );
// handles deletion correctly
</PRE>
But we cannot write:
<PRE>
shared_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; p( new int[10] );
// incorrect
</PRE>
This is an inconsistency. It is true that we have the
following workaround:
<PRE>
std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; s(new int[5],
std::default_delete&lt;int[]&gt;());
</PRE>
But this is still inconsistent, not to mention awkward and
error-prone because the programmer will occasionally
forget the deleter and the code will silently compile and
may appear to work on some platforms.

One reason that the unique_ptr constructor taking a
nullptr_t argument is not explicit is to allow conversion of
nullptr to unique_ptr in contexts like equality comparison.
Unfortunately operator== for unique_ptr is a little more
clever than that, deducing template parameters for both
arguments. This means that nullptr does not get deduced
as unique_ptr type, and there are no other comparison
functions to match.

<description>
Hash support based on ownership sharing should be
supplied for shared_ptr and weak_ptr.
For two shared_ptr objects p and q, two distinct
equivalence relations can be defined. One is based on
equivalence of pointer values, which is derived from the
expression p.get() == q.get() (hereafter called addressbased
equivalence relation), the other is based on
equivalence of ownership sharing, which is derived from
the expression !p.owner_before(q) &amp;&amp; !q.owner_before(p)
(hereafter called ownership-based equivalence relation).
These two equivalence relations are independent in
general. For example, a shared_ptr object created by the
constructor of the signature shared_ptr(shared_ptr&lt;U&gt;
const &amp;, T *) could reveal a difference between these two
relations. Therefore, hash support based on each
equivalence relation should be supplied for shared_ptr.
However, while the standard library provides the hash
support for address-based one (20.9.11.6 paragraph 2), it
lacks the hash support for ownership-based one. In
addition, associative containers work well in combination
with the shared_ptr's ownership-based comparison but
unordered associative containers don't. This is
inconsistent.&gt;BR/&gt;
For the case of weak_ptr, hash support for the ownershipbased
equivalence relation can be safely defined on
weak_ptrs, and even on expired ones. The absence of
hash support for the ownership-based equivalence
relation is fatal, especially for expired weak_ptrs. And the
absence of such hash support precludes some quite
effective use-cases, e.g. erasing the unordered_map entry
of an expired weak_ptr key from a customized deleter
supplied to shared_ptrs.<BR/>
Hash support for the ownership-based equivalence
relation cannot be provided by any user-defined manner
because information about ownership sharing is not
available to users at all. Therefore, the only way to provide
ownership-based hash support is to offer it intrusively by
the standard library.<BR/>
As far as we know, such hash support is implementable.
Typical implementation of such hash function could return
the hash value of the pointer of the counter object that is
internally managed by shared_ptr and weak_ptr.
</description>
<suggestion>
Add the following non-static member functions to
shared_ptr and weak_ptr class template;
<PRE>
// 20.9.11.2 paragraph 1
namespace std{
template&lt;class T&gt; class shared_ptr {
public:
...
size_t owner_hash() const;
...
};
}
// 20.9.11.3 paragraph 1
namespace std{
template&lt;class T&gt; class weak_ptr {
public:
...
size_t owner_hash() const;
...
};
}
</PRE>
These functions satisfy the following
requirements. Let p and q be objects of either
shared_ptr or weak_ptr, H be a hypothetical
function object type that satisfies the hash
requirements (20.2.4) and h be an object of the
type H. The expression p.owner_hash() behaves
as if it were equivalent to the expression h(p). In
addition, h(p) == h(q) must become true if p and q
share ownership.

1.4p9 states that which conditionally supported constructs
are available should be provided in the documentation for
the implementation. This doesn't help programmers trying
to write portable code, as they must then rely on
implementation-specific means to determine the
availability of such constructs. In particular, the presence
or absence of std::chrono::monotonic_clock may require
different code paths to be selected. This is the only
conditionally-supported library facility, and differs from the
conditionally-supported language facilities in that it has
standard-defined semantics rather than implementationdefined
semantics.
</description>
<suggestion>
Provide feature test macro for determining the
presence of std::chrono::monotonic_clock. Add
_STDCPP_HAS_MONOTONIC_CLOCK to the
&lt;chrono&gt; header, which is defined if
monotonic_clock is present, and not defined if it is
not present.

The library component monotonic_clock is conditionally
supported, but no compile-time flag exists that allows
user-code to query its existence. Further-on there exist no
portable means to simulate such a query. (To do so, user
code would be required to add types to namespace
std::chrono.)

Section 17.6.4.8, Data Race Avoidance, requires the C++
Standard Library to avoid data races that might otherwise
result from two threads making calls to C++ Standard
Library functions on distinct objects. The C standard
library is part of the C++ Standard Library and some C++
Standary library functions (parts of the Localization library,
as well as Numeric Conversions in 21.5), are specified to
make use of the C standard library. Therefore, the C++
standard indirectly imposes a requirement on the thread
safety of the C standard library. However, since the C
standard does not address the concept of thread safety
conforming C implementations exist that do no provide
such guarantees. This conflict needs to be reconciled.

The expression is required to return the iterator

in N2023, this requirement makes it impossible to achieve
average O(1) complexity for unordered associative
containers implemented with singly linked lists. This has a
theoretical as well as a practical impact, as reported by
users of early implementations of these containers.
Discussions among committee members have not found
any way of remedying this deficiency (other than
acknowledging it) by some smart modification of usual
singly linked lists implementations.

vector&lt;bool&gt; iterators are not random access iterators
because their reference type is a special class, and not
'bool &amp;'. All standard libary operations taking iterators
should treat this iterator as if it was a random access
iterator, rather than a simple input iterator.
</description>
<suggestion>
Either revise the iterator requirements to support
proxy iterators (restoring functionality that was lost
when the Concept facility was removed) or add an
extra paragraph to the vector&lt;bool&gt; specification
requiring the library to treat vector&lt;bool&gt; iterators
as-if they were random access iterators, despite
having the wrong reference type.
</suggestion>
<notes></notes>
<rationale>The LWG does not wish to address this problem at this time. The preference is to deal with it with the more general proxy iterator problem.

The complex number functions added for compatibility
with the C99 standard library are defined purely as a
cross-reference, with no hint of what they should return.
This is distinct from the style of documentation for the
functions in the earlier standard. In the case of the
inverse-trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, a
reasonable guess of the functionality may be made from
the name, this is not true of the cproj function, which
apparently returns the projection on the Reimann Sphere.
A single line description of each function, associated with
the cross-reference, will greatly improve clarity.

All the random number engine types in this clause have a
constructor taking an unsigned integer type, and a
constructor template for seed sequences. This means that
an attempt to create a random number engine seeded by
an integer literal must remember to add the appropriate
unsigned suffix to the literal, as a signed integer will
attempt to use the seed sequence template, yielding
undefined behaviour, as per 26.5.1.1p1a. It would be
helpful if at least these anticipated cases produced a
defined behaviour, either an erroneous program with
diagnostic, or a conversion to unsigned int forwarding to
the appropriate constructor.

the precision the client desires. If RealType is float, the
densities vector is taking up twice as much space as the
client desires.

Change the piecewise constant and linear
distributions to hold / return the densities in a

If this is not done, at least
correct[rand.dist.samp.pconst]/13 which describes
the return of densities as a vector&lt;result_type&gt;.

Each use of the words "happens-before" should be

Rationale: Happens-before is defined in 1.10p11 in a way
that (deliberately) does not make it explicitly transitively
closed. Adding edges to happens-before directly, as in
27.2.3p2 etc., does not provide transitivity with
sequenced-before or any other existing happens-before
edge. This lack of transitivity seems to be unintentional.

For istreams and ostreams, the move-constructor does
not move-construct, the move-assignment operator does
not move-assign, and the swap function does not swap
because these operations do not manage the rdbuf()
pointer. Useful applications of these operations are
prevented both by their incorrect semantics and because
they are protected.
</description>
<suggestion>
In short: reverse the resolution of issue 900, then
change the semantics to move and swap the
rdbuf() pointer. Add a new protected constructor
that takes an rvalue reference to a stream and a
pointer to a streambuf, a new protected assign()
operator that takes the same arguments, and a
new protected partial_swap() function that doesn't
swap rdbuf().
See Appendix 1 - Additional Details

<rationale>The Library Working Group reviewed n3179 and concluded that this change alone was not sufficient, as it would require changes to some of the derived stream types in the library. The preference is not make such a broad fix, and retain the current semnatic. This is closed as NAD rather than NAD future as it will be difficult to rename the new functions introduced in the C++0x revision of the standard at a later date.

Resolve issue LWG 1328 one way or the other, but
preferably in the direction outlined in the proposed
resolution, which, however, is not complete as-is: in any
case, the sentry must not set ok_ = false if is.good() ==
false, otherwise istream::seekg, being an unformatted
input function, does not take any action because the
sentry object returns false when converted to type bool.
Thus, it remains impossible to seek away from end of file.

N3092 27.8.1.3 Member functions contains this text
specifying the postconditions of
basic_stringbuf::str(basic_string):<BR/>
"Postconditions: If mode &amp; ios_base::out is true, pbase()
points to the first underlying character and epptr() &gt;=
pbase() + s.size() holds; in addition, if mode &amp;
ios_base::in is true, pptr() == pbase() + s.data() holds,
otherwise pptr() == pbase() is true. [...]"<BR/>
Firstly, there's a simple mistake: It should be pbase() +
s.length(), not pbase() + s.data().<BR/>
Secondly, it doesn't match existing implementations. As
far as I can tell, GCC 4.5 does not test for mode &amp;
ios_base::in in the second part of that sentence, but for
mode &amp; (ios_base::app | ios_base_ate), and Visual C++ 9
for mode &amp; ios_base::app. Besides, the wording of the
C++0x draft doesn't make any sense to me. I suggest
changing the second part of the sentence to one of the
following:<BR/>
Replace ios_base::in with (ios_base::ate | ios_base::app),
but this would require Visual C++ to change (replacing
only with ios_base::ate would require GCC to change, and
would make ios_base::app completely useless with
stringstreams):<BR/>
in addition, if mode &amp; (ios_base::ate | ios_base::app) is
true, pptr() == pbase() + s.length() holds, otherwise pptr()
== pbase() is true.<BR/>
Leave pptr() unspecified if mode &amp; ios_base::app, but not
mode &amp; ios_base::ate (implementations already differ in
this case, and it's always possible to use ios_base::ate to
get the effect of appending, so it's not necessary to
require any implementation to change):
in addition, if mode &amp; ios_base::ate is true, pptr() ==
pbase() + s.length() holds, if neither mode &amp; ios_base::ate
nor mode &amp; ios_base::app is true, pptr() == pbase() holds,
otherwise pptr() &gt;= pbase() &amp;&amp; pptr() &lt;= pbase() +
s.length() (which of the values in this range is
unspecified).<BR/>
Slightly stricter:<BR/>
in addition, if mode &amp; ios_base::ate is true, pptr() ==
pbase() + s.length() holds, if neither mode &amp; ios_base::ate
nor mode &amp; ios_base::app is true, pptr() == pbase() holds,
otherwise pptr() == pbase() || pptr() == pbase() +
s.length() (which of these two values is unspecified).
A small table might help to better explain the three cases.
BTW, at the end of the postconditions is this text: "egptr()
== eback() + s.size() hold". Is there a perference for
basic_string::length or basic_string::size? It doesn't really
matter, but it looks a bit inconsistent.

Subclause 27.9.2 [c.files] specifies that &lt;cinttypes&gt; has
declarations for abs() and div(); however, the signatures
are not present in this subclause. The signatures
proposed under TR1 ([tr.c99.inttypes]) are not present in
FCD (unless if intmax_t happened to be long long). It is
unclear as to which, if any of the abs() and div() functions
in [c.math] are meant to be declared by &lt;cinttypes&gt;. This
subclause mentions imaxabs() and imaxdiv(). These
functions, among other things, are not specified in FCD to
be the functions from Subclause 7.8 of the C Standard.
Finally, &lt;cinttypes&gt; is not specified in FCD to include
&lt;cstdint&gt; (whereas &lt;inttypes.h&gt; includes &lt;stdint.h&gt; in C).

The Bitmask Type requirements in 17.5.2.1.3 p3 say that
all elements on a bitmask type have distinct values, but
28.5.2 defines regex_constants::match_default and
regex_constants::format_default as elements of the
bitmask type regex_constants::match-flag_type, both with
value 0. This is a contradiction.
</description>
<suggestion>
One of the bitmask elements should be removed
from the declaration and should be defined
separately, in the same manner as
ios_base::adjustfield, ios_base::basefield and
ios_base::floatfield are defined by 27.5.2.1.2p2
and Table 120. These are constants of a bitmask
type, but are not distinct elements, they have
more than one value set in the bitmask.
regex_constants::format_default should be
specified as a constant with the same value as
regex_constants::match_default.

their own macros, especially not macros that map to
keywords (which remains undefined behaviour)

Radioactivity<BR/>
Footnotes 343 and 344 from 29.1p1 and 29.3p8 read:
"Atomic objects are neither active nor radioactive" and
"Among other implications, atomic variables shall not
decay".<BR/>
We suggest that these be removed - the first is pretty
clearly a joke, but it's not obvious that the second doesn't
have some technical meaning.

29.3p8 1.9p13
</para>
<description>
Overlapping evaluations are allowed<BR/>
29.3p8 states:<BR/>
"An atomic store shall only store a value that has
been computed from constants and program input values
by a finite sequence of program evaluations, such
that each evaluation observes the values of variables
as computed by the last prior assignment in the
sequence."<BR/>
... but 1.9p13 states:
"If A is not sequenced before B and B is not
sequenced before A, then A and B are unsequenced.
[ Note: The execution of unsequenced evaluations can
overlap. -end note ]"<BR/>
Overlapping executions can make it impossible to
construct the sequence described in 29.3p8. We are not
sure of the intention here and do not offer a suggestion for
change, but note that 29.3p8 is the condition that prevents
out-of-thin-air reads.<BR/>
For an example, suppose we have a function invocation
f(e1,e2). The evaluations of e1 and e2 can overlap.
Suppose that the evaluation of e1 writes y and reads x
whereas the evaluation of e2 reads y and writes x, with
reads-from edges as below (all this is within a single
thread).
<PRE>
 e1           e2
Wrlx y--   --Wrlx x
      rf\ /rf
         X
        / \
Rrlx x&lt;-   -&gt;Rrlx y
</PRE>
This seems like it should be allowed, but there seems to
be no way to produce a sequence of evaluations with the
property above.<BR/>
In more detail, here the two evaluations, e1 and e2, are
being executed as the arguments of a function and are
consequently not sequenced-before each other. In
practice we'd expect that they could overlap (as allowed
by 1.9p13), with the two writes taking effect before the two
reads. However, if we have to construct a linear order of
evaluations, as in 29.3p8, then the execution above is not
permited. Is that really intended?

The first sentence of 29.6p23 was changed by n2992 but
now makes no sense: "that is, return false while leaving
the contents of memory pointed to by expected before the
operation is the same that same as that of the object and
the same as that of expected after the operation."
There's a minor editorial difference between n2992 ("is
that same as that" vs "is the same that same as that") but
neither version makes sense.
Also, the remark talks about "object" which should
probably be "object or this" to cover the member functions
which have no object parameter.

implementor namespace is for. There is no benefit to
programmers from providing a way to portably detect that
an implementation provides non-portable extensions. The

become portable because implementations will differ on

Specifications of unlock member functions and unlock
mutex requirements are inconsistent wrt to exceptions and
pre- and postconditions.
</description>
<suggestion>
unlock should specifiy the precondition that the
current thread "owns the lock", this will make calls
without holding the locks "undefined behavior".
unlock in [mutex.requirements] should either be
noexcept(true) or be allowed to throw
system_error like unique_lock::unlock, or the latter
should be nothrow(true) and have the precondition
owns==true.
Furthermore unique_lock's postcondition is wrong
in the case of a recursive mutex where owns
might stay true, when it is not the last unlock
needed to be called.

The mutex requirements force try_lock to be

that try_lock may throw. This means the requirement is

mutex and recursive_mutex should have an is_locked()
member function. is_locked allows a user to test a lock
without acquiring it and can be used to implement a lightweight

Add a member function:
<PRE>
bool is_locked() const;
</PRE>
to std::mutex and std::recursive_mutex. These
functions return true if the current thread would
not be able to obtain a mutex. These functions do
not synchronize with anything (and, thus, can
avoid a memory fence).

The term "associated asynchronous state" is long, ugly
and misleading terminology. When introduced we agreed
upon that we should come up with a better name. Here it
is: "liaison state". Since the state is hidden and provides
synchronization of a future with its corresponding promise,
we believe "liaison state" is a much better and shorter
name (liaison ~ (typically hidden) relationship)

The note in this paragraph says "unlike future, calling get
more than once on the same atomic_future object is well
defined and produces the result again." There is nothing
in future that says anything negative about calling get
more than once.

Remove this note, or add words to the
requirements for future that reflect what this note
says.

Both future and shared_future specify that calling most
member functions on an object for which valid() == false
produces undefined behavior. There is no such statement
for atomic_future.

[futures.atomic_future]/2 with the same words as

Paragraph 7-8

<description>
According to the definition of atomic_future, all members
of atomic_future are synchronizing except constructors.
However, it would probably be appropriate for a move
constructor to be synchronizing on the source object. If
not, the postconditions on paragraphs 7-8, might not be
satisfied. This may be applicable if a collection of futures
are being doled out to a set of threads that process their
value.

Make the move constructor for atomic future lock

<description>
The third sentence says "If the invocation is not deferred,
a call to a waiting function on an asynchronous return
object that shares the associated asynchronous state
created by this async call shall block until the associated
thread has completed." The next sentence says "If the
invocation is not deferred, the join() on the created
thread..." Blocking until a thread completes is not
necessarily a join.
</description>
<suggestion>
Decide whether the requirement is to block until
finished or to call join, and rewrite to match.

<description>
Providing only three different possible values for the enum
launch and saying that launch::any means either
launch::sync or launch::async is very restricting. This
hinders future implementors to provide clever
infrastructures that can simply by used by a call to
async(launch::any,...). Also there is no hook for an
implementation to provide additional alternatives to launch
enumeration and no useful means to combine those (i.e.
interpret them like flags). We believe something like
async(launch::sync | launch::async, ...) should be allowed
and can become especially useful if one could say also
something like async(launch::any &amp; ~launch::sync, ....)
respectively. This flexibility might limit the features usable
in the function called through async(), but it will allow a
path to effortless profit from improved hardware/software
without complicating the programming model when just
using async(launch::any,...)
</description>
<suggestion>
Change in 30.6.1 'enum class launch' to allow
further implementation defined values and provide
the following bit-operators on the launch values
(operator|, operator&amp;, operator~ delivering a
launch value).<BR/>
Note: a possible implementation might use an
unsigned value to represent the launch enums,
but we shouldn't limit the standard to just 32 or 64
available bits in that case and also should keep
the launch enums in their own enum namespace.<BR/>
Change [future.async] p3 according to the
changes to enum launch. change --launch::any to
"the implementation may choose any of the
policies it provides." Note: this can mean that an
implementation may restrict the called function to
take all required information by copy in case it will
be called in a different address space, or even, on
a different processor type. To ensure that a call is
either performed like launch::async or
launch::sync describe one should call
async(launch::sync|launch::async,...)

Representations of reference link are not unified.
Most reference links to clause (table) number, say X, are
in the form "Clause X" ("Table X") capitalized, and
subsection Y.Y.Y is referenced with its number only in the
form "Y.Y.Y". Whether they are parenthesized or not
depends on the context.
However there are some notations "(Z)" consisting of only
a number Z in parentheses to confer Clause or Table
number Z.
